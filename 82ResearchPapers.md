# Research Paper

Research projects will focus on description and characterization of how interaction among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (The Critical Zone) support and influence life. A 10-minute presentation, and a 3000-word, properly-referenced report of the student-identified and instructor-approved topic that addresses one of the grand challenges in geosciences and the role that the CZ plays.

## Goal of Research Paper

Scholarly articles are built to convey ideas around a research endeavor and are built to answer the "five W's":

> What, Why, When, Where, and What did they find?

A proper article will also be built on the shoulders of previous work, and the research question posed by the authors will clearly follow from that past work in way that emphasizes the author's knowledge of the subject area and his/her creativity and curiosity to pose a new, novel question.

## Structure 

The following are important sections that are to be included in your research term paper. The points next to each section are the relative grade distribution for the research paper. The following are important sections that are to included in your research paper.

### Title
Should be concise and informative. The title should cover all the main themes of your final project. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems, so be sure to cover all the main keywords in your title. Avoid abbreviations and formulae.

### Abstract
A concise and factual abstract (maximum length 100-150 words) -- this is your "elevator pitch" to someone regarding the major findings of your final project. The abstract should briefly state the purpose of the research, the principal findings, and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. Non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.

### Introduction
Introduce the rationale for the study and outline the objectives and possible hypotheses (maximum length 500-750 words). Avoid a detailed literature survey on the subject or a summary of the results from the current study. Include a methodology of how you collected your information, data, etc.

### Results and Discussion
Clear and concise description of your results of your investigation (maximum length 1000-1250 words). Discussion should explore the significance of the results. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate, but you can also separate them. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.

### Conclusions
The main conclusions of the study (maximum length 100-150 words) may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a *Discussion* or *Results and Discussion* section.

### References
Include at least 10 research articles that are cited in the body of the research paper. Provide a list (alphabetically) of all the articles, books, etc. you cited in your paper. Use the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html) for formatting. I highly recommend using the [Mendeley Reference Manager](https://www.mendeley.com/guides) for managing your bibliography. 

### Figures and Tables
Figures and tables should convey key information and need to be embedded in the main paper and not at the end. Each figure and table needs a caption. A caption should comprise a brief title and a description of the illustration or the data in the table and include citations for the source of the figure or table. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used. Number tables and figures consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text. All figures and tables need to be cited in the body of the paper.

## Writing style 

There is some debate about using active ("We found that...") vs. passive voice ("The results show that..."). Technical writing usually is in passive voice, but journals are becoming more willing to consider well-written papers using the active voice.

Verb tenses: A common problem is using mixed verb-tense. Just remember when you write about something in the past, use past tense (the Methods section should be entirely in past tense). The Results section and Discussion sections can have some mixed tenses as appropriate (e.g., "The results show that ..." or "There was an inverse relationship between temperature and specific conductance as measured in the stream samples..."). Also, in the Discussion it may be appropriate to use future verb tense ("These results will be used to guide management decisions ...")

## Literature review 

The following databases are comprehensive for your literature reviews: [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/), [Google Scholar]
(https://scholar.google.com/), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/), and Web of Science and GeoRef. All databases allow searching keywords and sub-searches, so start a bit more broadly and then add additional terms to narrow it down.

When conducting literature review, create a useful search phrase: this is easier said than done and will take a few tries to get it right. You want to cast a broad net but not too wide, so you have thousands of articles to sort.

## Grading Rubric 

Each section in the paper will be graded as per the rubric shown below.

| Description              | %   |
| ------------------------ | --- |
| Organization and clarity | 25  |
| Appropriate content      | 50  |
| Writing and grammar      | 25  |
| Total                    | 100 |


# Research Presentation

The research presentation should be in the format of an oral presentation of your research project as you explain the main points to a broader nonscientific audience. You can use any platform for this presentation. Use photos, maps, and any other relevant information. Total length should be 5 minutes (about 5-7 slides).

## Grading Rubric 

The overall presentation will be graded as per the rubric below.

| Description                                             | %   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Clearly relays main research findings of study          | 30  |
| Effectively presents the topic to nontechnical audience | 20  |
| Organized and coherent presentation with useful visuals | 35  |
| Provides information for the viewer to learn more       | 20  |
| Total                                                   | 100 |
