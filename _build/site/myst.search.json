Soils are not randomly distributed; instead, they occupy spaces influenced by the overlapping factors of soil formation. Ultimately, soil demonstrates the interplay of atmospheric, lithospheric, hydrologic, and biological processes, reflecting the intricate workings of the Critical Zone (CZ).\n\nWe will use online resources to examine the distribution of soils at a site of your choosing and consider how this distribution aids our understanding of CZ processes and land use at that location.\n\nThe function of the CZ is characterized by interconnected physical, biological, and chemical processes, which are studied by experts in various fields such as geology, soil science, biology, ecology, geochemistry, geomorphology, and hydrology, among others.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:The soil CZ concept is perhaps best illustrated by a four-leaf clover-like emblem of yellow (representing atmosphere), green (biosphere), blue (hydrosphere), and brown (lithosphere) surrounding the acronym SoilCritZone; the design of the logo symbolizes how soil and the CZ exist within the overlapping region between the four “spheres.”\n\nWhile these disciplines are equally crucial for understanding the CZ, they are linked by the presence of soil, which many consider the central component of the CZ.

It refers to the superficial, unconsolidated, and usually weathered part of a planet’s mantle, especially on Earth (\n\nSoil Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster).\n\nSoil is defined as earth material altered by physical, chemical, and biological agents, allowing it to support upright, rooted plants. Engineers include all regolith in this definition as well (\n\nGlossary of Geology | American Geosciences Institute).\n\n(i) Soil refers to the unconsolidated mineral or organic material on the Earth’s surface that is a natural medium for land plants’ growth. (ii) It is also the unconsolidated mineral or organic matter that has been affected by various genetic and environmental factors, such as climate (including the effects of water and temperature) and macro- and microorganisms shaped by the landscape and acting on parent material over time. A product-soil exhibits different physical, chemical, biological, and morphological properties compared to the material from which it is derived (\n\nGlossary of Soil Science Terms | Soil Science Society of America).\n\nSoil is the naturally occurring, loose covering of broken rock particles and decaying organic matter (known as humus) on the Earth’s surface, capable of supporting life. In simple terms, soil consists of three components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase is a mixture of mineral and organic matter, which forms a loose structure filled with voids. The solid phase accounts for about half of the soil’s volume, while the remaining space contains water (liquid) and air (gas). Soil is often referred to as earth, which is the substance from which our planet derives its name (\n\nSoil - Wikipedia).\n\nWhile these four definitions share common elements, they also differ in focus. Agronomists and most soil scientists emphasize the study of the rooted zone or rhizosphere (approximately to a depth of one meter). In contrast, geologists take a broader and deeper view, examining material down to the original parent material, which can reach depths of up to one hundred meters or more. Most scientists agree that soil is a complex biomaterial that supports the growth of terrestrial organisms and is vital for life on Earth. It results from the weathering of parent material, the decomposition of plant matter, and atmospheric deposition. Since soil resources are finite, humanity must recognize their non-sustainable nature and learn to care for and sustain these essential resources. This unit focuses on soil, the “heart” of the Critical Zone (CZ).\n\nWatch the following video about soil and soil formation by Octavia Hopwood.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/soiloverview#definitions-of-soil","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.2 The Role of Soil","lvl2":"Soil Background"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/soiloverview#soil-background","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.2 The Role of Soil","lvl2":"Soil Background"},"content":"When examining a soil pit or a roadside cut, you will notice different layers within the soil known as soil horizons. The arrangement of these horizons within a particular soil is referred to as a soil profile. Soil scientists, also known as pedologists, study and describe soil profiles and horizons to classify and interpret soil for various applications.\n\nSoil horizons vary in several observable properties, including color, texture, structure, and thickness. However, some properties are less visible. For instance, chemical and mineral content, consistency, and reactivity require specific laboratory tests. All of these properties are essential for defining different types of soil horizons.\n\nSoil scientists use capital letters O, A, B, C, and E to denote the master horizons, while lowercase letters are used for distinctions within these horizons. Most soils possess three main horizons: the surface horizon (A), the subsoil (B), and the substratum (C). Some soils may also feature an organic horizon (O) at the surface, although this horizon can sometimes be buried. The master horizon E signifies subsurface horizons that have experienced significant mineral loss, a process known as eluviation. Hard bedrock, classified separately from soil, is represented by the letter R.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Basic sequence of soil horizons. Note that only some horizons may be present in any given location due to the soil formation factors specific to that location.

The “mineral” components of soil are formed from rocks and minerals’ physical and chemical weathering. Soil formation is controlled by five variables in nature, represented by the equation below:\\text{Soil/Ecosystems}=f(Cl,O,R,P,T,...)\n\nwhere, Cl is climate, O is organisms, R is topographic relief, P is parent material, and T is time.   The soil-forming factors have these important characteristics: (1) they are independent of the system (soil/ecosystems) being studied, and (2) in many parts of the Earth, the state factors (Cl, O, R, P, T, etc.) vary independently of each other.\n\nThe rate of soil formation can be expressed in differential form asdS=\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial Cl}dCl + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial O}d O + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial R}dR + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial P}dP + \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}dT\n\nWhile this differential form is not precisely quantitative, it gives us an idea of which variable(s) is likely dominant in any given setting.\n\nSee \n\nIntroduction to partial derivatives (article) | Khan Academy for a simple introduction to partial derivatives and multivariate calculus.\n\nThe soil formation rates have not been as thoroughly characterized as erosion. This creates a challenging situation for scientists and land-use planners concerned about soil erosion’s impacts. While we know that there are locations on Earth where soil is eroding at unsustainable rates, it raises the question: are there sites where soil forms at a rate that equals or exceeds the erosion rate? If such sites exist, soil erosion may not be a significant concern for land-use decisions in those areas. Therefore, accurately determining soil formation rates under various conditions is critical in critical zone science.\n\nAdditionally, many scientists recognize that human activity has greatly influenced much of the critical zone, representing a sixth factor in soil formation. The varying distribution of these factors, known as state factors, across the Earth’s surface leads to differences in soil development’s physical, chemical, and biological processes. This variability plays a significant role in soil formation and the emergence of different soil types.\n\nIn the videos below, Professor John Graveel of Purdue University discusses soil formation and properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/soiloverview#soil-formation","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.2 The Role of Soil","lvl2":"Soil Orders"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/soiloverview#soil-orders","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.2 The Role of Soil","lvl2":"Soil Orders"},"content":"Due to the diverse climates, geography, and geology, soils develop unique characteristics that reflect their local regions. Soil scientists have created a system to classify and name soils, known as soil taxonomy. Soils are classified as natural entities based on the characteristics of their profiles.\n\n\n\nThere are 12 major soil orders worldwide represent broad climate types and soil development processes. Within each order, there are multiple suborders. To learn more about these major orders, visit \n\nThe Twelve Orders of Soil Taxonomy | Natural Resources Conservation Service (usda.gov).\n\nSoil suborders are subdivisions of soil orders based on specific characteristics that reflect soil formation processes or environmental conditions. Each order comprises several suborders, and the name of a suborder typically ends with a suffix indicating the order it belongs to. For example, the suborders of Alfisols (soils rich in aluminum and iron) end with the suffix -alf, such as \n\nAqualfs, Udalfs, Ustalfs, and Xeralfs.\n\nThe criteria for defining soil suborders vary depending on the order. Still, we generally consider soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, horizon development, clay mineralogy, organic matter content, and parent material. Some soil suborders are more widespread than others, depending on the geographic distribution of the soil orders and the environmental factors that influence soil formation. For instance, Ultisols (soils with low base saturation and high weathering) are primarily found in humid regions such as the southeastern United States, parts of South America, Africa, and Asia. They are divided into five suborders: \n\nAquults, Humults, Udults, Ustults, and Xerults. Aquults are Ultisols with a water table at or near the surface for extended periods during the year, while Xerults are Ultisols that experience a four to six months dry season.\n\nState soils are soils that hold special significance for particular states. Each state in the United States has designated a state soil, with twenty of these selections established legislatively. To learn more, visit \n\nState Soils | Natural Resources Conservation Service (usda.gov).\n\nThe USDA-NRCS maintains a soil map of the United States at \n\nWeb Soil Survey (usda.gov). Navigate to this site to learn how to generate a soil report for your area of interest. It’s not the most intuitive site, so watch the video to help create a soil report for your specific location.\n\n\n\nUC Davis has a nice map-based interface that allows you to navigate the NRCS data more efficiently.

Since the upper layers tend to have higher organic matter and nutrients, erosion can cause significant negative impacts on agriculture and water pollution. An inch of soil may take a thousand years to build but could be removed in one rainstorm. Thin layers of soil on top of shallow bedrock and frequently tilled soils are particularly sensitive, as erosion may lead to a loss of agricultural productivity.  Excessive erosion leads to an environmental disaster called desertification \n\nDesertification | UNCCD. See the simple demonstration below on soil health.\n\n\n\nThere is a growing movement focusing on holistic management of soil and regenerative agriculture, as described in the video below.\n\n\n\nWhat aspects of the cultural zone (CZ), besides soil, are affected by soil erosion and other threats to soils? Are these impacts beneficial or harmful? For instance, while the erosion of weathered material can deplete the soil, the transport and deposition of those particles contribute to the gradual formation of floodplains and deltas in other areas. Additionally, moderate soil erosion can introduce nutrients into the water cycle, which various organisms depend on to survive and thrive.","type":"content","url":"/soiloverview#soil-erosion","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.2 The Role of Soil","lvl2":"Readings and resources for this section"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/soiloverview#readings-and-resources-for-this-section","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.2 The Role of Soil","lvl2":"Readings and resources for this section"},"content":"Hudson, T.

These outputs act as “information” that returns to various points within the system. Feedback information can guide and sometimes control further system operations, often forming pathways known as feedback loops.\n\nWhen feedback information discourages change in the system, it is referred to as negative feedback. In other words, negative feedback occurs when taking a specific action, which leads to fewer instances of that action. For example, suppose you email your instructor with questions about this course and receive clear answers. In that case, you will likely have fewer questions, resulting in less need to send clarification emails. Negative feedback promotes stability within the classroom system and reduces the need for extra assistance.\n\nConversely, when feedback information encourages change in the system, it is called positive feedback. For instance, if you email your course instructor with questions and receive confusing responses that lead to more inquiries, you will likely continue to send additional emails as your questions multiply. In this case, positive feedback creates instability within the classroom system; if it remains unchecked, this feedback loop could ultimately lead to you dropping the class.\n\nIt’s important to note that negative feedback is not inherently “bad,” nor is positive feedback necessarily “good.” Each type of feedback relates to system stability: negative feedback opposes changes in the system and leads to stability, while positive feedback encourages instability, and if left unchecked, it can result in a runaway effect. In natural systems, such unrestrained changes can reach critical limits, leading to system disruption or even the death of organisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of Earth system science, systems consist of components that are interconnected and typically interact in complex ways. These systems can also interact with other systems. The interactions or relationships between these components are referred to as couplings.\n\nPositive couplings occur when a change in one component—regardless of whether an increase or decrease—results in a change in the same direction in a linked component. In contrast, negative couplings mean that a change in one component leads to a change in the opposite direction in the linked component.\n\nFeedback loops are pathways of change and response. Negative feedback loops tend to reduce or mitigate the effects of change, while positive feedback loops usually amplify changes.\n\nThe state of a system is described by its characteristics at a specific moment in time. Changes in the state of a system are driven by:\n\nInteractions with other systems\n\nInteractions among components within the same system","type":"content","url":"/systemsoverview#systems-feedback","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.3 Systems Approach","lvl2":"System Equilibrium"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/systemsoverview#system-equilibrium","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.3 Systems Approach","lvl2":"System Equilibrium"},"content":"Most systems maintain their structure and characteristics over time. An energy and material system that remains balanced over time, where the conditions are consistent, is said to be in a steady-state condition. When the rates of inputs and outputs in the system are equal, and the amounts of energy and matter stored within the system fluctuate around a stable average, the system is in steady-state equilibrium. For example, river channels often adjust their shape in response to varying water and sediment inputs. Although the amounts of these inputs may change yearly, the river channel’s form represents a stable average—a steady-state condition.\n\n\n\nSystems in equilibrium tend to maintain their functional operations and resist sudden changes. However, a system may reach a threshold, or tipping point, beyond which it can no longer retain its characteristics, leading to a drastic shift in its operations. For instance, a significant flood in a river system can push the river channel to this threshold, causing it to carve a new path abruptly. Similarly, a landslide can alter a hillside or coastal bluff, driving it toward a new equilibrium that balances slope, materials, and energy over time.\n\nPlant and animal communities can also reach these thresholds. A notable case is the decline of frog populations in response to a deadly fungus that has spread globally; over 200 known species—approximately 3% of the total—have gone extinct since 1970. Scientists estimate that by 2100, 10% of all frog species may be lost.\n\n\n\nAn equilibrium state remains unchanged unless the system is disturbed. Temporary disturbances to a system are called perturbations, while persistent disturbances are known as forcing. If slight disturbances cause a system to move further from equilibrium, it is considered unstable.","type":"content","url":"/systemsoverview#system-equilibrium","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.3 Systems Approach","lvl2":"System Models"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/systemsoverview#system-models","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.3 Systems Approach","lvl2":"System Models"},"content":"A model is a simplified and idealized representation of part of the real world that helps us understand complex processes. Scientists design models with varying degrees of detail. A conceptual model is typically the most generalized and focuses on how processes interact within a system. In contrast, a numerical model is more specific and usually based on field or laboratory work data. The simplicity of a model makes a system easier to understand and simulate in experiments. An example is a model of the hydrologic system, which represents Earth’s entire water system, its related energy flows, and the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface environments through which water moves.\n\nThe storage and movement of material and energy in a group of interacting systems is often represented as a box model. A box model can illustrate the following essential features of a system:\n\nThe processes by which matter (or energy) enters and leaves the system and the rates at which these exchanges occur.\n\nThe processes by which matter (or energy) moves among the various parts of the system internally, and the rates at which this movement happens.\n\nThe amount of matter (or energy) in the system at a given time and distribution.\n\nAs illustrated in \n\nFigure 2, the “boxes” in a box model represent the locations where water (or energy, or any material of interest) is stored for a period within the system. These storage locations are referred to as reservoirs. When the flow of matter into a reservoir matches the flow out of that reservoir, we say that the reservoir is at steady state. The average time water spends in these reservoirs is known as its residence time. The residence time of material in a particular reservoir is influenced by many factors, including the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the material itself, the characteristics of the reservoir, and any external forces or processes acting on either the material or the reservoir.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:The global hydrological cycle is shown as a box model in this figure.

Readers can refer to citations in your bibliography and look up the materials themselves. When inspired by your text or arguments, interested researchers may want to verify a claim or interpretation you’ve made or continue researching based on their interests. However, while a bibliography offers a list of research sources with publishing details, it often lacks comprehensive information about the sources themselves.\n\nAn annotated bibliography provides specific information about each source you have used. As a researcher, you become an expert on your topic, enabling you to explain the content of your sources, assess their usefulness, and share this information with others who might be less familiar with them. Consider your paper part of a conversation with people who share your interests; the annotated bibliography allows you to recommend resources, suggest what might be worth checking out, and indicate what may not be worth the reader’s time. It’s akin to providing a list of good movies for your classmates and discussing them, explaining why one movie is better or why a particular student might enjoy one film more. Your goal is to give your audience enough information to understand the main content of the sources and make informed decisions about where to direct their attention based on their interests.\n\nAn annotated bibliography consists of citations for books, articles, and documents. Each citation is followed by a brief (usually about 150 words) descriptive and evaluative paragraph known as the annotation. The annotation informs the reader about the cited sources’ relevance, accuracy, and quality.\n\nIt is important to note that annotations are not abstracts. Abstracts are purely descriptive summaries commonly found at the beginning of scholarly journal articles or in periodical indexes. Annotations are descriptive and critical; they may discuss the author’s perspective, authority, and the clarity and appropriateness of expression.","type":"content","url":"/basictoolsanalysis#what-is-annotated-bibliography","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.1 Basic Tools and Analysis","lvl3":"What does an annotated bibliography do?","lvl2":"Annotated Bibliography"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/basictoolsanalysis#what-does-an-annotated-bibliography-do","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.1 Basic Tools and Analysis","lvl3":"What does an annotated bibliography do?","lvl2":"Annotated Bibliography"},"content":"A Good Annotated Bibliography:\n\nEncourages critical thinking about the content of the works you are using, their place within a field of study, and their relation to your research and ideas.\n\nDemonstrates that you have read and understand your sources.\n\nEstablishes your work as a valid source and you as a competent researcher.\n\nSituate your study and topic within an ongoing professional conversation.\n\nProvides a way for others to determine whether a source will be helpful to their research.\n\nHelps interested researchers gauge their interest in a topic by providing background information and an overview of the current work in the field.","type":"content","url":"/basictoolsanalysis#what-does-an-annotated-bibliography-do","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.1 Basic Tools and Analysis","lvl3":"What Elements Might an Annotation Include?","lvl2":"Annotated Bibliography"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/basictoolsanalysis#what-elements-might-an-annotation-include","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.1 Basic Tools and Analysis","lvl3":"What Elements Might an Annotation Include?","lvl2":"Annotated Bibliography"},"content":"A bibliography in the appropriate citation style (MLA, APA, CBE/CSE, etc.).\n\nAn explanation of the work’s main points and/or purpose—essentially, its thesis—demonstrating that you have read and thoroughly understood the source.\n\nVerification or critique of the authority or qualifications of the author.\n\nComments on the work’s worth, effectiveness, and usefulness of your research topic and project.\n\nThe point of view or perspective from which the work was written.

It typically consists of a tall tower equipped with multiple instruments, including sensors for measuring wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The data collected by an eddy flux tower provides valuable insights into the processes that control the exchange of energy, water, and carbon between the land and the atmosphere. This information is crucial for understanding the Earth’s carbon cycle and the impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe NSF-funded National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has installed several eddy covariance towers across the United States.

Parent material can consist of various rock types with differing geochemical compositions, which may be lithified (hardened) or unconsolidated. This material can also range from relatively recent to billions of years old. The geological context of a region, both in the past and present, determines the existence of mountains or valleys, significantly influencing the topographic setting in which CZ processes operate and soils are formed.

This technique is used in relative age dating. In brief, an intrusive rock body is younger than the rocks it disrupts.\n\nFor example, \n\nSalisbury Crag, a well-known landmark in Edinburgh that Hutton studied, owes its distinct shape to a thick layer of resistant basalt. Through his observations of the heated contacts above and below the basalt and where the basalt intruded into the underlying and overlying sedimentary layers, Hutton demonstrated that this thick basalt body was not simply a flow that had formed in succession. Instead, it was intruded as hot magma into the surrounding sedimentary rocks long after those rocks had been deposited (\n\nEicher 1976).\n\nSimilar relationships include faults younger than the rock layers they cut through and erosional surfaces younger than the eroded rocks.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Hutton’s Section on Edinburgh’s \n\nSalisbury Crags.

Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona.\n\nWilliam Smith (1769–1839), an engineer and surveyor, traveled extensively throughout England’s countryside. He identified and mapped numerous sedimentary rock units while investigating roads, quarries, mines, and canals. Smith observed that each successive rock layer contained a unique set of fossils. His key finding—that strata can be identified by their fossil content—became the law of faunal succession. This discovery allowed geologists to use fossils to differentiate rock units of various ages. Consequently, faunal succession emerged as a fundamental principle for categorizing and recognizing rock units across different regions.\n\nAlthough Smith’s findings raised questions about ancient life that were not easy to answer then, they made it possible to correlate distant localities. A framework was established to assign a stratigraphic classification based on the temporal relationships of strata rather than relying solely on rock types, which had previously been thought to indicate age. In summary, this was the crucial discovery that stratigraphic geology needed to advance further (\n\nEicher 1976).","type":"content","url":"/geomorphology#faunal-succession-and-fossil-correlation","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Organic Evolution","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/geomorphology#organic-evolution","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Organic Evolution","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"content":"\n\nFigure 4:Fossil trackway in the Coconino Sandstone (about 260 million years old) made by \n\nChelichnus, a reptile-like mammal.

However, until Charles Darwin’s time, the theory had not gained widespread acceptance, primarily due to earlier scientists lacking crucial data and the Huttonian concept of geologic time, which are essential for the evolutionary argument. Darwin’s significant contribution was proposing a mechanism—natural selection—to explain how evolutionary change occurs.\n\nA key requirement for evolution is that sufficient time is needed to produce these changes, which is where the concept of \n\nuniformitarianism comes into play. This idea serves as the first link in Darwin’s chain of reasoning. The relationship between organic evolution and geologic time is that the randomness of minor, fortuitous evolutionary variations in species—resulting in noticeable changes in an organism’s physical form—requires immense time. Building on uniformitarianism, Darwin formulated a compelling and rational argument for the origin of our world’s diverse organisms.","type":"content","url":"/geomorphology#organic-evolution","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Organic Extinction","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/geomorphology#organic-extinction","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Organic Extinction","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"content":"\n\nFigure 5:Jurassic Dinosaur bones of the Morrison formation at the Quarry Exhibit Hall. Dinosaur National Monument, Utah.\n\nFor over 300 years, naturalists have recognized that fossils are the remains of once-living plants and animals. They proposed that particular species formerly existing were no longer alive; in other words, they had become extinct. However, the concept of extinction took some time to gain acceptance among the majority. The main reason for this hesitance was that the most well-known fossils were marine invertebrates. While these fossils are just as valid as terrestrial organisms in demonstrating extinction, little was understood about ocean life at the beginning of the 19th century. Aware of the significant gaps in their knowledge, naturalists of that era were reluctant to assert that certain marine animals represented by fossils no longer existed anywhere on Earth; they considered the possibility that these organisms might still be living in some deeper, unexplored part of the ocean (\n\nEicher 1976).\n\nFollowing William Smith’s work on faunal succession, \n\nGeorges Cuvier (1769–1832), a French naturalist and zoologist, developed the stratigraphic sequences of terrestrial vertebrates and marine invertebrates in the strata of the Paris Basin. In 1812, Cuvier conclusively demonstrated that many fossil vertebrates had no known living counterparts, and people acknowledged that it was improbable for such large land animals to go undiscovered (\n\nEicher 1976).\n\nLike William Smith, Cuvier recognized distinctive fossils, but he placed greater emphasis on the changes in these fossils over time. As Cuvier meticulously mapped the succession of different faunas in the strata of the Paris Basin, he observed that the younger deposits contained creatures more similar to modern-day species than the older deposits (\n\nEicher 1976). Thus, Cuvier not only proved the extinction of species but also showed that each changing sequence of faunas corresponds to a specific period in the geological past.","type":"content","url":"/geomorphology#organic-extinction","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Superposition and Original Horizontality","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/geomorphology#superposition-and-original-horizontality","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Superposition and Original Horizontality","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"content":"\n\nFigure 6:Cross-bedded sandstone of the Jurassic Navajo formation.

Through his studies in the mountains of western Italy, Steno discovered that the principle of superposition in stratified rocks is crucial for linking time to these rocks. Essentially, each layer of sedimentary rock, also known as a “bed,” is older than the layer above it and younger than the layer below it. This seemingly simple superposition rule has become the most fundamental principle of relative dating. Although Steno initially based his conclusions on observations of sedimentary rocks, the principle also applies to other materials deposited on the surface, such as lava flows and volcanic ash beds.\n\nAdditionally, Steno recognized the importance of another principle: original horizontality. This principle states that strata are initially deposited in nearly horizontal positions. Therefore, if a rock layer is folded or inclined at a steep angle, it indicates that the layer has been moved into that position by crustal disturbances (such as mountain building, faults, or plate tectonics) sometime after it was deposited.","type":"content","url":"/geomorphology#superposition-and-original-horizontality","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Uniformitarianism","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/geomorphology#uniformitarianism","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl3":"Uniformitarianism","lvl2":"Fundamental Geological Principles"},"content":"Uniformitarianism is a fundamental concept in geology. It asserts that the same natural laws and processes that operate today have always been at work throughout Earth’s history. In other words, the present is the key to understanding the past. Let’s delve into this principle:\nUniformitarianism posits that Earth’s geological processes—both gradual and sudden—have consistently shaped the planet over time. Events such as earthquakes, the erosion of river valleys, and volcanic eruptions occur today as they did in the past.\n\nBefore 1830, scientists adhered to the theory of catastrophism, which argued that significant, abrupt changes (or catastrophes) were responsible for shaping Earth’s features, such as mountains. However, two influential figures challenged this perspective:\n\nJames Hutton (1726–1797), a Scottish farmer and naturalist, observed that natural processes—like mountain-building and erosion—occurred gradually over time. He formulated the Principle of Uniformitarianism, emphasizing the slow, continuous forces that shape the Earth’s surface.\n\nCharles Lyell (1797–1875), a Scottish geologist, further championed uniformitarianism. His book, Principles of Geology, debunked catastrophism. Lyell found evidence that sea levels had risen and fallen, volcanoes could form atop older rocks, and valleys eroded slowly due to the power of water.\n\nThe combined efforts of Hutton and Lyell laid the foundation for modern geology. Interestingly, Charles Darwin, the father of evolutionary biology, viewed uniformitarianism as support for his theory of species emergence. He recognized that the evolution of life required vast periods, which geology confirmed.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:Colorado River near Nankoweap Creek.

Hutton observed various processes such as wave action, erosion caused by running water, and sediment transport. He concluded that, given enough time, these processes could explain the geological features of his native Scotland. He believed that “the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.” This idea that present-day processes have been at work throughout geological time formed the basis of the principle of uniformitarianism.\n\nBefore Hutton, no one had effectively demonstrated that geological processes could occur over long periods. Hutton convincingly argued that seemingly weak, slow-acting processes could, over extensive timescales, produce effects as significant as those resulting from sudden catastrophic events. Unlike his predecessors, Hutton supported his ideas with verifiable observations.\n\nAlthough Hutton developed a comprehensive theory of uniformitarian geology, Charles Lyell became its principal advocate. Lyell successfully interpreted and publicized uniformitarianism for the wider audience. Hutton’s concept of uniformitarianism, combined with his complex and challenging literary style, did not capture the imagination of his contemporaries. As a result, geologists often credit Lyell with advancing the fundamental principles of modern geology. Lyell’s \n\nPrinciples of Geology is a landmark text in the history of science and is as influential to modern worldviews as the works of Charles Darwin. In 1990, the University of Chicago Press republished his works. In the first of three volumes, Charles Lyell presents the uniformitarian argument: the processes currently observable in the natural world are essentially the same as those that have acted throughout Earth’s history and are sufficient to explain all geological phenomena.","type":"content","url":"/geomorphology#the-present-is-the-key-to-the-past","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl2":"Plate Tectonics"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/geomorphology#plate-tectonics","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Geology and Geomorphology","lvl2":"Plate Tectonics"},"content":"We live on a layer of Earth known as the lithosphere, which consists of rigid slabs that shift and slide against one another.

The theory of plate tectonics has been revolutionary in helping us understand how these landscapes were formed in the past and how they continue to change during our lifetimes.\n\nThe story of plate tectonics begins deep within the Earth. Each layer has its own unique properties and chemical composition. The thin outer layer, where we live, is divided into several plates that move relative to one another.

Chronostratigraphy is the branch of geology that focuses on the relationships and ages of rock units in relative time. This means that in chronostratigraphy, we are concerned with how the ages of different rock bodies relate, regardless of their specific numerical age.\n\nFossils offer a quick and precise way to determine the relative age of rocks within a stratigraphic sequence. However, we cannot assign an absolute age to these fossils until we have established a time scale. Geochronology is the branch of stratigraphy dedicated to dating and subdividing geological time and establishing time scales.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Geologic time scale shows the geologic eons, eras, periods, epochs, and associated dates from millions of years ago (MYA). The time scale also indicates the onset of major evolutionary and tectonic events affecting the North American continent and the Northern Cordillera (SCAK, south-central Alaska; SEAK, southeast Alaska; NAK, northern Alaska; CAK central Alaska). Image source: \n\nGeologic Time Scale - Geology (nps.gov)\n\nBefore geologists had the means to determine the actual ages of rocks, they based correlations on the principle of superposition, which states that older rocks are deposited before younger rocks. Geological time was divided into a hierarchy of chronostratigraphic units with unknown durations. The advent of radiometric dating techniques to ascertain the absolute ages of rocks gave rise to the discipline of geochronology and enabled the establishment of geological time scales.\n\nNo single location on Earth has experienced a continuous accumulation of sediments or rocks that can be dated to yield an ideal reference time scale. A chronostratigraphic scale is not simply discovered; it is established by consensus among numerous geologists and is based on a composite of various sections. An ideal chronostratigraphic section, which would contribute to a larger composite, would have the following attributes: a nearly continuous sequence of marine deposition; fossils that are abundant, distinctive, diverse, cosmopolitan, well-preserved, and free from significant paleoenvironmental changes; minerals suitable for isotopic age determinations; and a record of geomagnetic polarity reversals. Additionally, these “type” sections should be well-exposed, easily accessible, and readily correlatable to other sections.\n\nOnce a chronostratigraphic scale is agreed upon, it serves as a recognized standard that remains unchanged until it is reevaluated and modified based on better stratigraphic sections or improved analytical techniques. Consequently, no chronostratigraphic scale is ever wholly finalized.\n\nA chronostratigraphic scale integrated with absolute ages (geochronology) is termed a geological time scale. Since Arthur Holmes published the first geological time scale in 1913, nearly two dozen time scales have been proposed. Each scale incorporated the latest standard stratigraphic sections, biostratigraphy, and age-dating developments. The most recent time scale, edited in 2004 by Felix Gradstein and colleagues, integrated high-resolution radiometric and astronomical age-dating into a comprehensive time scale covering the last 3.85 billion years (with the age of the Earth estimated at 4.54 billion years).

Each landform possesses unique characteristics that differentiate it from others. This distinction is fundamental to \n\ngeomorphology, which is the field-oriented study of landforms at the intersection of geology and various other disciplines that seek to understand surface processes. The applications of geomorphic knowledge are diverse, ranging from engineering projects that address the physical properties of landforms to geological studies that explore the record of past climate change as reflected in these landforms. This lack of rigid philosophical boundaries is perhaps geomorphology’s greatest strength—its interdisciplinarity.\n\nThe diversity within the Critical Zone is exemplified by the distribution of soils across different landforms, which reflects varying chemical and mechanical weathering processes such as physical erosion and chemical denudation. These processes, in turn, influence the internal structure of the Critical Zone and its function as a feed-through reactor. Changes in surface area, flow paths, and the residence time of materials impact the weathering fluxes of elements and nutrients.\n\nConsider the relationship between the Critical Zone as a feed-through reactor and \n\nisostasy. In a mountainous region where active erosion constantly removes weathered material from the summits, the unloading of this material enables the underlying crust to adjust through uplift. This process physically raises unweathered rock into the feed-through reactor. Over time, the landscape may evolve with low topography and minimal relief as the deep crustal root becomes exposed, weathered, and reaches isostatic equilibrium with the underlying mantle. Consequently, thick soil profiles develop, covering the unweathered rock and slowing the rate at which this rock is processed through the reactor.\n\nTopography, defined by the configuration of the land surface in terms of elevation, slope, and variations in landscape position, can accelerate or decelerate the effects of climate on parent material weathering by balancing erosion and pedogenesis. Since topography often reflects the distribution of different parent materials across many landscapes, detailed soil maps can aid in interpreting geological features, and in some cases, geological maps can be derived directly from soil maps.

Stream erosion is one of the most significant geomorphic processes. These fluvial processes shape the landscape by eroding landforms, transporting sediment, and depositing it to create new landforms. Both human civilization and ecosystems rely heavily on fluvial systems. Rivers provide water for hydroelectric power and shipping, and they support stream-side wetlands (riparian areas), which are essential for maintaining clean water and offering rich habitats.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:The drainage basin or watershed is a fundamental landscape unit in fluvial geomorphology.

Fluvial deposits are sediments carried and deposited by the flowing water of a stream.\n\nA floodplain is a relatively flat area adjacent to a river or stream. During floods, when the stream overflows its banks, water spreads out over the floodplain and deposits sediment. Through fluvial processes, streams build floodplains that can accommodate their maximum flood capacity. Depending on the geological setting, the geomorphic features of a floodplain may include natural levees, oxbow lakes, point bars, and terraces.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Illustration of channel features from Chaco Culture National Historical Park geologic report.

This difference in flow creates an erosional surface on the outer edge, known as a cut bank, and a depositional surface on the inner edge, called a point bar. When the bends of two meanders meet, they can bypass the river’s curve, forming an oxbow lake, which may eventually fill with sediment.\n\nMeanders change position by eroding sideways and slightly downstream. The sideways movement occurs because the maximum velocity of the stream shifts toward the outside of the bend, leading to erosion of the outer bank. Simultaneously, the reduced current inside the meander causes sediment, mainly sand, to be deposited. As a result, the stream moves laterally without altering the size of its channel. Due to the slope of the channel, erosion is more effective on the downstream side of a meander.

Some standard aeolian features include dunes, loess deposits, ventifacts, deflation hollows (or blowouts), and desert pavement.\n\nAeolian processes involve erosion, transportation, and sediment deposition by the wind. These processes can occur in various environments, such as coastal areas, cold and hot deserts, and agricultural fields. Key characteristics of these environments include sparse or nonexistent vegetation, a supply of fine sediment (including clay, silt, and sand), and strong winds. Aeolian processes are responsible for the mobilization of dust and the formation of dunes. They depend on other geological agents, like rivers, glaciers, and waves, to supply sediment for transport.\n\nDunes, which can be either active or stabilized by vegetation, are found along beaches and in arid or semi-arid regions. These dunes are mounds of loose sand created by wind and are among the most recognized aeolian features. There are various types of dunes, classified based on their shape. Most of them share a typical profile, including a long, shallow angle (the stoss side) facing the wind, a peak (the crest), and a steep leeward side.\n\nCoastal dunes play a critical role in the health and sustainability of sandy beaches. The primary dune ridge (foredunes) is adjacent to the shoreline, while secondary dune fields may extend further inland. Dunes can form wherever aeolian processes (i.e., wind transportation) occur. They protect back-barrier environments, including human development, against severe waves, wind, and storms. Additionally, these geomorphic features offer vital habitats for various migratory birds and mammals. The vegetation on dunes is crucial for forming and stabilizing dune complexes on barrier islands. The root systems and exposed foliage help restrict sand movement around the plants, securing the dunes.\n\nAeolian (Dunes) Landforms - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Illustration of dune types, White Sands National Monument, New Mexico.

They shape mountains, carve valleys, and transport vast amounts of rock and sediment.\n\nGlaciers create distinctive valleys that are steep-walled with flat bottoms. Examples of such valleys include U-shaped valleys, fjords, and hanging valleys. Cirques are bowl-shaped depressions that glaciers carve into high-elevation mountains and valley sidewalls. Features like nunataks, arêtes, and horns result from glacial erosion in areas where multiple glaciers flow in various directions. When glaciers are present, these features emerge as stark, rocky outcrops above the ice, enhancing the beauty of these rugged landscapes. Once the ice retreats, these uniquely shaped landforms provide clear evidence of past glacial movement.\n\nLateral and medial moraines consist of rock and debris transported by glaciers. Lateral moraines form along the sides of glaciers, while medial moraines develop at the junction where two tributary glaciers meet. Terminal and recessional moraines mark the furthest advance of a glacier—its terminus—at a specific time. The sediments produced through glacial grinding are distinctive. Glacial till contains a mixture of sediments ranging in size from tiny particles smaller than a grain of sand to large boulders. Glacial flour, the smallest sediment size, is responsible for the milky appearance of the water in rivers, streams, and lakes fed by glaciers.\n\nGlaciers can pick up chunks of rock and transport them over long distances. When these rocks are deposited, they often end up far from their original location, outcrop, or bedrock. Such rocks are known as glacial erratics.\n\nGlaciers move across the land and incorporate rock and sediment into the ice. These inclusions turn the glacier’s base, or sole, into a coarse sandpaper-like surface capable of scratching the underlying bedrock. Over time, as the glacier flows over the rock and sediment, it leaves behind striations or striae on the rock surfaces, indicating the direction of the glacier’s movement.\n\nGlaciers and Glacial Landforms - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)\n\nGlacier National Park Map Link\n\nNavigate and explore the Swiss Alps (Matterhorn and Zermatt) in the 3D map below:","type":"content","url":"/landformsremotesensing#glacial-landforms","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.2 Landforms and Remote Sensing","lvl3":"Karst Landforms","lvl2":"Types of Landforms"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/landformsremotesensing#karst-landforms","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.2 Landforms and Remote Sensing","lvl3":"Karst Landforms","lvl2":"Types of Landforms"},"content":"Karst is a landscape formed by the dissolution of bedrock, resulting in sinkholes, sinking streams, caves, springs, and other distinctive characteristics. This landscape is typically associated with soluble rock types like limestone, marble, and gypsum. Generally, a karst landscape develops when a significant amount of water on the surface interacts with and infiltrates the subsurface through cracks, fractures, and openings that dissolve into the bedrock. After traveling underground, sometimes for long distances, this water is discharged through springs, many of which serve as entrances to caves.\n\nA sinkhole is a depression or hole that occurs when the land surface collapses due to the dissolution of underground bedrock or cave collapse. In urban areas, catastrophic sinkhole collapses can lead to substantial damage and even loss of life.\n\nKarst landscapes are excellent for storing water as aquifers and provide vast amounts of clean drinking water for people, plants, and animals. Due to karst’s porous (Swiss cheese-like) nature, water flows quickly through it with minimal filtration. Consequently, contaminants that enter a karst aquifer are transported rapidly, creating potential water quality issues. Approximately 20% of the United States is underlain by karst landscapes, and 40% of the groundwater used for drinking comes from these karst aquifers.

Temperature measures the average kinetic energy, or average speed, of individual molecules in a substance. When molecular movement increases, the temperature rises. In contrast, heat is a form of energy that transfers between molecules and, consequently, between different bodies or substances. Heat is the flow of kinetic energy driven by a temperature difference.\n\nWhile heat is regarded as energy, temperature is related to the amount of energy in a substance. Heat crosses a system boundary in response to a temperature gradient. Since temperature reflects the average kinetic energy of molecules, it can also be understood as a measure of heat. An object with a “hot” temperature contains more heat energy, whereas an object with a “cold” temperature contains less.\n\nHeat always flows from matter at a higher temperature to matter at a lower temperature. This heat flow between objects or substances ceases once their temperatures, and thus their kinetic energy levels, equalize.\n\nWhen we apply these principles to the Sun and Earth, we observe that the hot Sun radiates shorter wavelengths of energy, primarily around 0.5 µm, with most radiation occurring in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In contrast, the cooler Earth emits energy at longer wavelengths, primarily in the infrared range, centered around 10 µm.\n\nAs electromagnetic energy travels through Earth’s atmosphere, certain gases, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, absorb specific wavelengths. These gases exhibit varying responses to radiation, being transparent to some wavelengths while absorbing others.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Of the 340 W m^{-2} of solar energy that falls on the Earth, 29 \\% is reflected into space, primarily by clouds, other bright surfaces, and the atmosphere itself.

Insolation arrives at the Earth’s surface as either direct or diffuse radiation. Direct sunlight creates shadows, while diffuse radiation provides a shadowless light seen in shaded areas or on cloudy days.

In the equatorial and tropical regions, there are only minor variations in day length and high sun altitude, resulting in relatively consistent insolation values ranging from approximately 180 to 220 W m². However, insolation decreases toward the poles, particularly around 25° latitude in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Generally, low-latitude deserts worldwide experience greater insolation at the surface due to frequently cloudless skies.\n\nAs insolation travels toward the Earth’s surface, it encounters an increasing density of atmospheric molecules. These gases, dust, cloud droplets, water vapor, and pollutants interact with insolation, redirecting radiation without changing its wavelengths. This phenomenon is known as scattering, and it accounts for some of the insolation that does not reach Earth’s surface but is instead reflected into space. Diffuse radiation is the portion of incoming energy that successfully reaches Earth’s surface after scattering.\n\nAdditionally, some of the arriving solar energy is directly reflected into space, a process called reflection. Over a year, clouds reflect about 20% of insolation, significantly more than what is reflected by Earth’s surface. Air pollutants, whether natural or man-made, also contribute to this reflection. The roles of clouds and aerosols in the Earth-atmosphere energy budget will be discussed further.\n\nAlbedo describes a surface’s reflective quality or intrinsic brightness. Albedo is an essential factor influencing the amount of insolation that reaches Earth, expressed as the percentage of insolation reflected: 0% indicates total absorption, while 100% signifies total reflectance.\n\nInsolation—both direct and diffuse—that is not part of the 31% reflected by Earth’s surface and atmosphere is absorbed either by the atmosphere or by Earth’s surface. Absorption involves the assimilation of radiation by molecules of matter, which converts radiation from one form of energy to another. Solar energy is absorbed by land and water surfaces (about 45% of insolation) and atmospheric gases, dust, clouds, and stratospheric ozone.

Sensible heat can be “sensed” as temperature because it comes from the kinetic energy of molecular motion. To feel this heat, radiant energy from the Sun must first be absorbed. Latent heat, or “hidden” heat, is the energy gained or lost when a substance changes from one state to another, from liquid water to water vapor or from liquid water to ice. Unlike sensible heat transfer, latent heat transfer occurs without a change in the substance’s temperature while it undergoes a physical change. However, the surroundings may gain or lose heat. The latent heat absorbed during evaporation is a significant component of the Earth-atmosphere energy system.\n\nHeat energy, called thermal energy, can be transferred throughout the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and water bodies through several processes. Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves.\n\nConduction involves the molecule-to-molecule transfer of heat energy as it diffuses through a substance. When molecules warm up, their vibration increases, causing them to collide with neighboring molecules, transferring heat from warmer to cooler areas.\n\nIn gases and liquids, energy is also transferred through convection, which transfers heat by mixing or circulation. In the atmosphere or bodies of water, warmer (less dense) masses tend to rise, while cooler (denser) masses sink, establishing convection patterns.

The mass of sediment available for transport can be approximated using rock density, \\rho (in kg m^{-3}), and regolith depth, H_S (in m), where m = \\rho \\cdot H_S, assuming that all soil and saprolite layers have the potential to be physically transported.\n\nThe mass and energy flux associated with chemical denudation and specific mineral transformations can be approximated using the Gibbs free energy \\Delta_{rxn}G^\\circ (in J mol^{-1}) of a given mineral transformation reaction under the relevant environmental conditions, along with the associated mass flux:E_{GEO} = N \\Delta_{rxn}G^\\circ\n\nIn this equation, N represents the mass flux per unit area (in mol m^{-2} s^{-1}), a function of reaction rate and stoichiometric coefficient.\n\nThe term \\xi encompasses the net energy flux associated with any additional material flux into the system, such as dust, atmospheric solutes, or anthropogenic inputs like fertilizers or other amendments.\n\nGenerally, some energetic fluxes may be negligible relative to other terms but can be relevant for specific ecosystems. Over annual timescales, the relative magnitude of the individual fluxes indicates that latent heat transfer by evapotranspiration is the most significant energy flux. However, as noted, this energy is transferred mainly from the CZ back to the atmosphere, resulting in a less direct impact on subsurface development.\n\nConsidering the range of values, the key parameters for quantifying the flux of energy into and through the subsurface CZ are E_{PPT} and E_{BIO}. These parameters describe the fraction of energy and mass effectively transferred into and through the subsurface CZ and are among the two parameters initially included in the EEMT term.","type":"content","url":"/energybudget#effective-energy-and-mass-transfer","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"4.1 Energy Budget","lvl2":"Water Budget"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/energybudget#water-budget","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"4.1 Energy Budget","lvl2":"Water Budget"},"content":"The hydrological cycle is crucial in transporting and cycling nutrients and energy. To manage water effectively and fairly, it’s essential to quantify the various components of the hydrological cycle, a process known as constructing a water budget for a specific area. Human activities have altered the hydrological cycle, impacting specific water budget components and the water movement between these components.\n\n\n\nFigure 6:Global water cycle and how human water use affect where water is stored, how it moves, and how clean it is. Image source: \n\nWater Cycle Diagrams | U.S. Geological Survey (usgs.gov)\n\nA water budget is a quantitative approach used to assess the availability and sustainability of water supply. It essentially states that the change in the amount of water stored in a specific area, such as a watershed, is balanced by the water inflow and outflow rate. Understanding the water budget and the associated hydrological processes is vital for effective water resource and environmental planning and management.\n\nMonitoring changes in the water budget over time can help evaluate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on water resources. Comparing water budgets from different regions allows quantifying how geology, soil, vegetation, and land use influence the hydrological cycle. Additionally, the water budget significantly quantifies energy and mass transfer within the Earth’s critical zone (CZ).\n\nThe water balance equation in its most simple form is shown as:\\Delta S = i - q\n\nIn this equation, the change in water storage (\\Delta S) in a system is equal to the difference in the inflow (i) and the outflow (q). This water balance equation can be expanded to be a little more informative as follows:P + Q_{In} = ET + Q_{Out} + \\Delta S\n\nwhere Q is water flow into (Q_{In}) or out (Q_{Out}) of a watershed (can be separated into groundwater and surface water components), P is precipitation, ET is evapotranspiration (sum of evaporation from soils, surface water bodies, and plants), and \\Delta S is change in water storage within the system.\n\nMeteorological and stream data will be required to calculate an annual water budget for a specific location.\n\nPrecipitation is typically measured using either automated or manual rain gauges. To calculate the total precipitation (P) for a watershed, multiple measurements are often taken across the area to estimate an average value. Additionally, identifying the watershed boundary is crucial for accurate calculations, known as watershed delineation. Automated tools, such as those available on \n\nStreamStats (usgs.gov), can assist in delineating the watershed of interest.\n\nEvapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in the water balance and influences soil moisture content, groundwater recharge, and streamflow. It is responsible for returning a substantial portion of the precipitation that falls on land to the atmosphere. Generally, ET is considered a loss in the water budget since it decreases streamflow, storage, and available groundwater. Various methods are available to measure ET (such as potted plants or lysimeters), but many research sites commonly employ the eddy covariance flux method. Due to the challenges in measuring ET, several estimation methods have been developed.\n\nDarcy’s law describes groundwater movement for saturated flow through porous media, expressed as follows:Q_{GW}= k_s A \\frac{dh}{dl}\n\nwhere Q_{GW} is groundwater discharge, k_s is saturated hydraulic conductivity (function of the type of rock or aquifer), A is an area of cross-section, and dh/dl is the hydraulic gradient (slope of the flow.)\n\nStreamflow in streams is commonly measured using the velocity-area method, as shown below:Q_{SW}=AV\n\nwhere, Q_{SW} is stream discharge, A is cross-sectional area of a stream, and V is the average velocity at a given location. In smaller streams with diffuse flows, “flumes” are installed.  In large streams, complex methods are used to measure discharge.

Since our planet and its atmosphere form a closed system, the total amount of carbon does not change. However, the location of carbon—whether in the atmosphere or within the Earth—is constantly shifting.\n\nOn Earth, most carbon is stored in rocks and sediments, while the rest is found in the oceans, atmosphere, and living organisms.

Our body mass reflects a delicate balance between the energy we consume through food and the energy we expend through various activities; any excess energy is stored. This principle applies to humans and other organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, biomes, and the biosphere.\n\nTwo aspects are essential to understanding the role of energy in ecosystems fully.

The amount of usable energy in a system sets an upper limit on the quantity of organic matter and, consequently, the amount of life that any ecosystem can sustain and, ultimately, by the Earth.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the only biological process capable of capturing energy from sunlight and converting it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to fuel its metabolism. It also produces oxygen, which is essential for many living organisms. In short, sunlight energy is “captured” to energize electrons, which are stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules.\n\nPlants, algae, and a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms that perform photosynthesis. Since they use light to create food, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, “self-feeders using light”). In contrast, other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (“other feeders”), as they rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A small group of bacteria synthesize sugars without using sunlight’s energy; these are known as chemoautotrophs.\n\nPhotosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires specific wavelengths of visible sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO_2, which is low in energy), and water (H_2O) as substrates. It releases oxygen (O_2) upon completing the process. It produces simple carbohydrate molecules (high in energy) that can be converted into glucose, sucrose, or other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain the energy and energized carbon all living things need to survive.6 \\text{CO}_2 + 6 \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow[Sunlight] \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6 + 6 \\text{O}_2\n\nThe total amount of organic matter on Earth, or within any specific ecosystem, is called the biomass of that system. This biomass includes all living organisms as well as the byproducts of these organisms. Since most life exists on or near Earth’s surface, biomass is typically measured as an amount per unit of surface area.\n\nPrimary producers convert energy and inorganic compounds into biomass, which takes the form of carbon-based organic compounds. The biomass production and its subsequent use as an energy source by autotrophs involves three key steps. First, the autotrophic organism synthesizes organic matter within its body, primarily through photosynthesis and, less commonly, through chemosynthesis. Next, some of this newly produced organic matter is utilized as fuel for metabolism and respiration, releasing energy back into the surrounding environment as heat. Finally, a portion of the freshly produced organic matter is stored for future use, also in the form of carbon-based compounds.\n\nThe first step, producing organic matter before any consumption occurs, is known as gross production. The biomass that remains after gross production once used to support life processes (the second step), is called net production.NPP = GPP - Re\n\nwhere, NPP is net primary production, GPP is gross primary production and Re is  respiration. This is a fundamental production relationship.","type":"content","url":"/carbonbudget#photosynthesis","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"4.2 Carbon Budget","lvl3":"Respiration","lvl2":"Carbon Budget"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/carbonbudget#respiration","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"4.2 Carbon Budget","lvl3":"Respiration","lvl2":"Carbon Budget"},"content":"Carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis are valuable to a plant when converted into energy.

When heterotrophs consume another organism, the energy stored in the organic compounds is released through one of two metabolic processes. Organisms that cannot tolerate oxygen derive their energy through anaerobic fermentation, where carbohydrate molecules partially decompose to produce alcohol, carbon dioxide, and water while releasing energy. On the other hand, heterotrophs that can tolerate oxygen extract their energy through the aerobic process known as respiration (or cellular respiration). This process uses oxygen to break down carbohydrates, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

This accounts for approximately 96.5 \\% of all of Earth’s water. The oceans are also estimated to supply about 90 \\% of the water that evaporates into the water cycle.\n\nThe water cycle and the volume of water in the oceans are dynamic. Over the “short term” of hundreds of years, the volume of the oceans does not change significantly. However, the amount of water in the oceans can vary over the long term. During the last Ice Age, sea levels were lower, and during colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers formed, sequestering a portion of the global water supply as ice. This accumulation reduces the water available in other parts of the water cycle. Conversely, during warmer periods, such as the last global warming phase approximately 125,000 years ago, sea levels were about 5.5 m higher than today. Three million years ago, sea levels could have been up to 50 m higher.\n\nWhile the amount of water trapped in glaciers and ice caps is a small percentage of all water on Earth, it represents a substantial portion of the world’s total freshwater.

This includes evaporation from the soil surface, the capillary fringe of the groundwater table, and bodies of water on land. Additionally, evapotranspiration encompasses transpiration and water movement from the soil to the atmosphere through plants. During transpiration, plants absorb liquid water from the soil and release water vapor into the air through their leaves.\n\n\n\nSoil evaporation and plant transpiration are both processes through which water is lost to the atmosphere, but they differ in how water moves from the soil to the air. In transpiration, water is absorbed by the plant’s roots, travels through the plant, and is vaporized in the leaves before escaping into the atmosphere through tiny openings called stomata. In contrast, soil evaporation occurs when water moves directly from the soil surface to the atmosphere. Evapotranspiration (ET) data are typically expressed as a depth of water loss over a specific time, similar to precipitation measurements, with standard units being inches per day (in d⁻¹) or millimeters per day (mm d⁻¹).\n\nFour key factors influence the rate of ET in a given environment. The most critical factor is soil moisture; without sufficient water in the soil, evaporation and transpiration cannot occur. However, when there is adequate soil moisture, three additional factors come into play: plant type, stage of plant development, and weather conditions.\n\nPlant type refers to the species or variety of cultivated plants and can significantly impact ET rates. For example, grasses and many non-native plants require substantial water in desert environments.  In contrast, many native plants have adapted to arid conditions and require much less water.\n\nThe stage of plant development also plays an essential role in determining ET. This stage encompasses the plant’s activity level (e.g., dormant vs. actively growing) and the size of the plant. Dormant plants use very little water, whereas lush, actively growing plants need considerably more. Additionally, the size and density of the plants affect ET; smaller plants and areas with sparse canopies use significantly less water than larger plants and areas with dense canopies.\n\nTogether, these factors dictate the overall evapotranspiration rate in any given environment.\n\nWeather is the fourth and final critical factor affecting evapotranspiration (ET). Weather conditions determine the energy available for evaporation, which is crucial in determining the ET rate. Four weather parameters - solar radiation (the amount of sunshine), wind speed, humidity, and temperature - impact the rate of ET.\n\nSolar radiation contributes significant energy to vegetation, especially in desert environments. It is often the meteorological parameter with the most significant impact on ET on most days. Solar radiation is one component of vegetation’s total radiant energy balance, known as net radiation. The other component is invisible infrared radiation. However, on most days, solar radiation is the dominant component of net radiation because the infrared balance is usually negative and relatively small.\n\nWind is the second most important factor influencing the ET rate. Wind serves two significant roles: first, it transports heat from adjacent surfaces (such as desert soils or asphalt) to vegetation, accelerating evaporation - a process known as advection. Additionally, wind enhances evaporation by improving the turbulent transfer of water vapor from moist vegetation to the drier atmosphere. This process involves the wind continually replacing the moist air within and just above the plant canopy with drier air from above.\n\nHumidity and temperature work together to determine the drying power of the atmosphere. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is the key meteorological variable to quantify this drying power. The VPD estimates the difference (or gradient) in vapor pressure (water vapor concentration) between moist vegetation and the drier atmosphere above. Relative humidity, the most commonly reported humidity variable in weather forecasts, is not a reliable indicator of atmospheric dryness. For example, the drying power (VPD) of an atmosphere with 30% relative humidity at 86°F is twice that of an atmosphere with the same 30% relative humidity at 68°F.\n\nThe final parameter affecting the ET rate is temperature. We have noted that temperature influences ET through its effects on VPD and advection. Moreover, there are more subtle ways in which temperature affects ET. When all other factors are equal, ET will be higher for warm vegetation than cool vegetation because less energy is needed to evaporate water from warm surfaces. Additionally, temperature affects the effectiveness of radiant energy and wind in promoting evaporation. Radiant energy is utilized more effectively for ET when temperatures are high, while wind significantly impacts ET when temperatures are low.\n\nEvapotranspiration is measured using an eddy covariance flux tower. This approach assumes that, within the boundary layer close to the Earth’s surface (50–100 meters), moisture transport is governed by eddies that move air with higher moisture content upward and air with lower moisture content downward. This process results in the mass transfer of moisture, referred to as fluxes, which represent the rate of transfer of wind and moisture across a unit area.\n\nSee \n\nEvapotranspiration and the Water Cycle | U.S. Geological Survey (usgs.gov)","type":"content","url":"/waterbalancetree#evapotranspiration","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.1 Water Balance of a Tree","lvl3":"Infiltration and Soil Water","lvl2":"Water Budget"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/waterbalancetree#infiltration-and-soil-water","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.1 Water Balance of a Tree","lvl3":"Infiltration and Soil Water","lvl2":"Water Budget"},"content":"Infiltration (f) is the process by which water enters the soil surface. This process is essential as it provides water for plant transpiration and contributes to groundwater recharge. Soil water refers to the amount of water contained within the soil and how tightly it is held within the soil matrix. Infiltration rates can be significantly affected by land management practices. The two primary forces involved in infiltration are gravity and capillary forces.\n\nSeveral factors influence the infiltration rate, including soil texture, land management practices, soil moisture, salinity, temperature, and frozen soil.\n\nSoil Texture: Coarse-textured soils, such as sandy loam or gravel, have larger pores and, therefore, exhibit higher infiltration rates compared to fine-textured soils like clay or silt loam, which have a more significant number of smaller pores. Additionally, clay pans or compacted layers within the soil can reduce infiltration. Hydraulic conductivity can express the differences in infiltration across various soil textures.\n\nSoil Structure: Features such as macropores, shrink/swell potential, and restricting layers can all influence infiltration. Surface sealing can decrease infiltration rates during rainfall, which is caused by the impact of rain and colloidal swelling. Thus, the surface cover of the soil is vital for optimizing infiltration.\n\nLand Management: Forest cover generally leads to greater infiltration rates than grasslands because the organic matter in forests promotes the formation of soil aggregates. Conversely, burning vegetation can reduce infiltration rates by removing soil organic matter and causing soil particles to lose aggregation. Burning can sometimes result in clogged soil pores, and burnt surfaces can become hydrophobic. Additionally, urban soil compaction can negatively impact infiltration. However, mulching can improve infiltration rates. Agricultural cropping often reduces infiltration since it exposes the soil to rainfall impact.\n\nSoil Moisture: The initial water content of the soil affects the infiltration rate. The infiltration rate decreases as the moisture content increases because the pores become filled with water. In arid, sandy soils, the infiltration rate can increase over time as trapped air is released, which initially impedes water infiltration.\n\nWater Quality: Certain chemical constituents in water can influence infiltration rates. For example, increased salinity lowers the infiltration rate. Sodium in water can break down aggregates and disperse soil particles, leading to clogged pores. Adding salt to soil can intentionally reduce infiltration rates; road salt has a similar effect. Highly turbid surface water can also decrease infiltration by clogging pores with sediment.\n\nTemperature: Water temperature affects its viscosity, influencing the infiltration rate. Higher temperatures generally increase infiltration rates, while increased viscosity decreases them. For instance, a temperature increase from 40°F to 100°F could double the infiltration rate.\n\nSoil Freezing: Soil frost can impact infiltration rates, with the effect varying depending on the type of frost present. Frozen soil is typically impervious to air and water. Specific land management practices can influence the type of frost that forms; for example, clear-cutting can lead to concrete frost formation due to reduced evapotranspiration, which may result in wetter soils in specific scenarios.\n\nOverall, understanding these factors is crucial for managing soil water resources effectively.","type":"content","url":"/waterbalancetree#infiltration-and-soil-water","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.1 Water Balance of a Tree","lvl4":"Measuring Infiltration:","lvl3":"Infiltration and Soil Water","lvl2":"Water Budget"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/waterbalancetree#measuring-infiltration","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.1 Water Balance of a Tree","lvl4":"Measuring Infiltration:","lvl3":"Infiltration and Soil Water","lvl2":"Water Budget"},"content":"This section will address methods to measure infiltration rates effectively and quantitatively.  Water infiltration into soil is typically measured using different types of infiltrometers.\n\nDouble-ring infiltrometer consists of two concentric metal or plastic rings driven into the soil. Water is poured into the inner ring, and the outer ring helps to minimize the lateral movement of water away from the inner ring. The rate at which water enters the soil in the inner ring is measured over time.\n\n\n\nA disc infiltrometer is a portable device with a disc-shaped base placed on the soil surface. Water is supplied to the disc at a known rate, and the steady-state infiltration rate is calculated based on the water intake needed to maintain a constant level of water on the disc.\n\n\n\nIn all cases, the measurements are taken over time, and the infiltration rate is typically expressed in units of length per unit of time (e.g., cm hr^{-1} or mm hr^{-1}). The data can characterize the soil’s hydraulic properties and inform irrigation scheduling, drainage design, and hydrological modeling.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:A mini disc infiltrometer measures the water infiltration rate and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Image source: \n\nEdaphic Scientific\n\nThere are two fundamental ways to characterize soil moisture. The first aspect is the soil’s water or water content. The amount of water is essential for soil recharge and overland flow. The second aspect is the energy status of soil moisture, which is important for evapotranspiration, tree growth, and water movement in the soil.\n\nBoth direct and indirect methods are used to determine soil water content. A soil moisture measurement can be obtained directly by gravimetric (weighing) methods.  Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is based on the dielectric constants for water and soil, the latter of which is a function of the soil water content.  A microwave pulse is sent through a steel rod, producing a waveform on an oscilloscope, which also measures the transit time of the pulse.","type":"content","url":"/waterbalancetree#measuring-infiltration","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.1 Water Balance of a Tree","lvl2":"Water Budget of a Tree"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waterbalancetree#water-budget-of-a-tree","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.1 Water Balance of a Tree","lvl2":"Water Budget of a Tree"},"content":"\n\n\n\nPlants are remarkable hydraulic engineers. They can move water to the tops of trees using only the fundamental laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential energy. Additionally, plants can generate enough hydraulic force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks.\n\nTrees transport water from their roots to their leaves through a specialized vascular tissue called xylem. The xylem forms a continuous system of interconnected conduits that extend from the roots, through the trunk and branches, and into the leaves. This process occurs in several steps:\n\nRoot Uptake: The root hairs and fine roots absorb water from the soil through osmosis. The water then enters the xylem vessels in the roots.\n\nTranspirational Pull: As water evaporates from the leaf surfaces—a process known as transpiration—it creates a negative pressure or tension within the xylem vessels of the leaves. This tension is transmitted down through the interconnected xylem conduits.\n\nCapillary Action: The cohesive forces between water molecules and the adhesive forces between water and the xylem vessel walls create a continuous water column within the xylem. This mechanism allows the transpirational pull to be transmitted down to the roots.\n\nRoot Pressure: In some cases, particularly during the spring, the roots can generate a positive pressure known as root pressure, which helps push water up through the xylem.\n\nXylem Transport: The combination of transpirational pull and root pressure, along with water’s cohesion and adhesion properties, causes the water to move upward through the xylem vessels from the roots to the leaves.\n\nThe xylem vessels are reinforced with lignin, which provides structural support and prevents the vessels from collapsing under the negative pressure created during transpiration. This efficient water transport system enables trees to move large volumes of water, even to great heights, to meet the demands of leaf transpiration.\n\n\n\nWater potential is crucial in water transport from the roots to tree leaves. It measures the potential energy of water, determining the direction and rate of water movement within the plant’s vascular system. Here’s how water potential influences this process:\n\nSoil Water Potential: Water moves from higher water potential to areas of lower water potential. The water potential in the soil is typically higher than that in the plant’s roots, driving the initial uptake of water from the soil into the root xylem.\n\nRoot Water Potential: Water entering the root xylem lowers the water potential in the roots compared to the surrounding soil, thereby maintaining the driving force for further water uptake.\n\nTranspirational Pull: Transpiration from the leaves creates a low water potential in the leaf cells. This change is transmitted through the continuous xylem conduits as tension or negative pressure. The transpirational pull establishes a water potential gradient from the roots to the leaves, facilitating the upward movement of water.\n\nCohesion-Tension Theory: The cohesive forces between water molecules (due to hydrogen bonding) and the adhesive forces between water and the hydrophilic xylem vessel walls allow the transpirational pull to be effectively transmitted through the xylem. This occurs even over long distances without breaking the continuous water column.\n\nRoot Pressure: In some cases, roots can generate positive pressure, which increases the water potential in the root xylem, contributing to the overall driving force for water transport.\n\nThe water potential gradient created by transpiration, combined with the cohesive and adhesive properties of water, ensures that water moves from the soil (higher water potential) into the roots, through the xylem, and ultimately to the leaves (lower water potential) to replenish the water lost through transpiration. This continuous process, driven by differences in water potential, is essential for maintaining water balance and supporting tree physiological processes.\n\nThe water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix effects. Water potential can be broken down into its components using the following equation:Ψ_{system}=Ψ_{total}=Ψ_s+Ψ_p+Ψ_g+Ψ_m\n\nThe symbols Ψ_s, Ψ_p, Ψ_g, and Ψ_m represent the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. The term system can refer to the water potential in various compartments, including soil water (Ψ_{soil}), root water (Ψ_{root}), stem water (Ψ_{stem}), leaf water (Ψ_{leaf}), or the water in the atmosphere (Ψ_{atmosphere}). Changes in the individual components of these potentials either increase or decrease the total water potential of a system.\n\nWhen this happens, water moves to achieve equilibrium, transitioning from a compartment with higher water potential to one with lower water potential. This movement continues until the difference in water potential between the two systems (\\Delta Ψ) reaches zero (\\Delta Ψ = 0). For water to flow through a plant from the soil to the air - a process known as transpiration - the following relationship must be maintained: Ψ_{soil} > Ψ_{root} > Ψ_{stem} > Ψ_{leaf} > Ψ_{atmosphere}.\n\nWater movement is driven solely by \\Delta Ψ, rather than by the individual components themselves. However, since these components influence the overall Ψ_{system}, a plant can regulate water movement by adjusting the individual components, particularly the solute potential (Ψ_s).\n\nSee \n\nTransport of Water and Solutes in Plants - Biology 2e | OpenStax for information about how water flows through a plant system.\n\n\n\nFigure 5:The cohesion–tension theory of sap ascent is shown. Evaporation from the mesophyll cells produces a negative water potential gradient that causes water to move upwards from the roots through the xylem. Image source: \n\nTransport of Water and Solutes in Plants\n\nPlant transpiration is essentially an invisible process. Water evaporates from the surfaces of leaves, but we cannot see the leaves “breathing.” One way to visualize transpiration is to place a plastic bag around some leaves. During a growing season, a single corn plant can transpire around 4 L/day, a mature oak tree can transpire up to 400 L/day, and a hectare of actively growing forest can transpire more than 50,000 L/day. At the ecosystem level, transpiration rates can vary, ranging from less than 1 mm/day in arid regions to over 5 mm/day in tropical forests (note that these units are similar to those used for precipitation).\n\nSince water vapor also evaporates from the soil, we would have observed even more water vapor captured if we had wrapped the plastic bag around the soil.\n\nSeveral factors influence evapotranspiration in a critical zone (or ecosystem):\n\nTemperature: Higher temperatures generally increase transpiration rates due to greater evaporative demand.\n\nHumidity: Lower humidity results in higher transpiration rates, as the air can hold more water vapor.\n\nWind: Increased wind speed can enhance transpiration by removing the saturated air surrounding the leaves.\n\nLight: Higher light levels (e.g., full sun) usually increase transpiration as stomata open wider.\n\nWater Availability: Transpiration rates decrease when soil water is limited, helping to prevent excessive water loss.\n\nWater Balance of a Tree\n\nConsider the water balance at the scale of a single tree.

In this case, each gauge is assigned an equal weight. If n = 3, each gauge would receive a weight of \\frac{1}{3}. This approach is equivalent to summing all the measurements P and dividing by the total number of gauges.\n\nHowever, a significant drawback of the direct averaging method is that it assumes the gauges are positioned in a manner that adequately captures the actual spatial variability of precipitation.

This bisector marks a boundary where locations are equidistant from the two points.\n\nMeeting of Bisectors: As more bisectors are drawn, they will intersect, forming the vertices of polygons.\n\nCompleting the Polygon: Once all necessary bisectors are drawn, the polygons are complete, with each polygon surrounding its respective sample point.\n\nKey Features and Assumptions: Each polygon represents the area of influence of its central sample point. Any location inside a particular Thiessen polygon is closer to its central sample point (or “source point”) than any other sample point outside the polygon.\n\nInterpolate: Finally, use the value of the central point of each Thiessen polygon to estimate values at unknown locations.\n\nExample of Thiessen Polygon Interpolation\n\nIn the following watershed area, there are six meteorological stations where annual precipitation values are reported.\n\nMet  Station\n\nPrecipitation, mm\n\n1\n\n985\n\n2\n\n1015\n\n3\n\n963\n\n4\n\n1101\n\n5\n\n1057\n\n6\n\n1078\n\nCalculate the annual precipitation for the entire area.\n\nStep 1: Draw lines connecting all the points to their two nearest neighbors.\n\nStep 2: Draw lines that bisect (divide the lines in half) perpendicular to the lines connecting the points.\n\nStep 3: Lengthen or shorten all lines to make them connect. Note that they should all come to a single point.\n\nStep 4: Remove all the unnecessary lines.\n\nStep 5: Once the final image is obtained, the proportions of each polygon to the whole should be calculated. This can be performed using geometry or by printing the Thiessen polygons on graph paper and counting the boxes in each polygon.\\% \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\text{No. of Pixels in polygon }}{\\text{No. of Pixels in Extent}} \\times 100\\%\n\nStep 6: Calculate the weighted precipitation value for the area around each met stationP_\\text{area} = P_\\text{Met Station} \\times \\text{Area}\n\nStep 7: Calculate the weighted precipitation for the entire extentP_\\text{Basin} = \\sum (P_\\text{Met Station} \\times \\text{Area})\n\nSetting all the calculations in a table, we can see that the  precipitation for the entire basin is 1047.2 mm\n\nMet Station\n\nPrecip.

The hypsometric method combines the elevation distribution within a watershed with a known relationship between precipitation and elevation to assign weights to different elevation classes.\n\nOne advantage of the hypsometric method, particularly in mountainous terrain, is that it considers the factors that cause spatial variability in precipitation. Using this method, researchers can calculate the average precipitation over a watershed based on the elevation distribution and the precipitation-elevation relationship.\n\nThe hypsometric method is particularly useful for estimating precipitation in mountainous areas, where the relationship between elevation and precipitation is often non-linear. Additionally, the method is relatively straightforward, making it a practical choice for watershed-scale studies.\n\nHypsometric Weighting Method\n\nTo calculate aerial precipitation using the hypsometric method, follow these steps:\n\nObtain the distribution of elevation within the watershed.

This heightened evaporation in one area of the Earth results in increased precipitation in another. Extreme weather events are causing significant water scarcity, excessive rainfall, and degraded water environments. \n\nThese effects on the water cycle pose serious threats to sustainable development, biodiversity, and people’s access to water and sanitation.\n\nAccording to the \n\nlatest IPCC Assessment Report, managing water resources is a top priority in adaptation strategies.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Projected changes of annual maximum daily maximum temperature, annual mean total column soil moisture, and annual maximum 1-day precipitation at global warming levels of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C relative to 1850–1900. Projected (a) annual maximum daily temperature change (°C), (b) annual mean total column soil moisture (standard deviation), (c) annual maximum 1-day precipitation change (%). The panels show CMIP6 multi-model median changes. In panels (b) and (c), large positive relative changes in dry regions may correspond to small absolute changes. In panel (b), the unit is the standard deviation of interannual variability in soil moisture during 1850–1900. Standard deviation is a widely used metric in characterizing drought severity. A projected reduction in mean soil moisture by one standard deviation corresponds to soil moisture conditions typical of droughts that occurred about once every six years during 1850–1900.\n\nImage source: \n\nFigures: AR6 Synthesis Report (ipcc.ch)\n\nIn many regions of the western United States, mountains function as “water towers.” However, societal demand for water in these mountainous areas is relatively low. In California, precipitation falls in the mountain ranges and flows through rivers, man-made aqueducts, and canals to regions with higher water demand. Additionally, the snowpack acts as a natural reservoir, gradually releasing water downstream as it melts.\n\nCalifornia experiences a rainy season in winter and spring, followed by a dry season in the summer and early fall. This dry period coincides with the peak of the agricultural growing season when water demand is at its highest. Residential and commercial areas generally do not alter water usage to align with natural supply fluctuations. To mitigate this issue, large reservoirs have been built to store winter precipitation and snowmelt. These reservoirs help regulate the downstream flow of streams and rivers.\n\nLand development can significantly impact the water balance of a watershed. Changes in land use or cover can alter the magnitude and pattern of various components of the water balance, leading to increased water management challenges (e.g., \n\nSchilling et al., 2008,\n\nKundu et al., 2017).\n\nAs water stress increases, wildfires are also expected to rise. Wildfires release ash and contaminants into streams, lakes, and water reservoirs. The vegetation that typically retains soil and water is burned away, which can lead to additional geological hazards. \n\nAccording to EPA, after a large wildfire, rainstorms can wash significant amounts of ash, sediment, nutrients, and contaminants into streams, rivers, and downstream reservoirs. Fire suppression efforts in the western U.S. mountains have resulted in dense forests with high evapotranspiration, increasing the risk of wildfires. Restoring natural wildfire regimes in these forests could modify hydrology by changing the composition and structure of vegetation. Still, the specific effects on the water balance remain uncertain \n\n(Boisramé et al., 2019).\n\nFire suppression can also have a considerable impact on water quality. Runoff from fire suppression can contaminate soil and water with toxic or hazardous materials. Direct exposure to soil and water from hazardous materials, which may spill due to fire, can lead to air contamination through smoke plumes and their subsequent dispersal. This can result in the deposition of particulates and other contaminants, further compromising soil and water quality \n\n(Martin et al., 2016).","type":"content","url":"/waterbalanceimpacts#water-management-and-balance","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.2 Water Balance Impacts","lvl2":"Readings and resources for this section"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/waterbalanceimpacts#readings-and-resources-for-this-section","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.2 Water Balance Impacts","lvl2":"Readings and resources for this section"},"content":"Goulden, Michael L., and Roger C.

Many of these data points are interconnected. Recognizing patterns within these data is crucial for understanding the functions of the CZ system.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that simplifies data complexity by identifying patterns and relationships between variables. PCA condenses numerous variables into smaller sets that capture the most important information, effectively reducing the dimensions. It is similar to summarizing a lengthy article into a concise version that highlights the key points.\n\n\n\nHere’s a clear summary of how PCA (Principal Component Analysis) works:\n\nImagine a collection of data points: These data points can represent various aspects, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), soil type, types of trees, and the age of trees in a forest. Each point has multiple features or variables associated with it.\n\nIdentify the overall pattern: PCA uncovers the directions in which the data varies the most. You can think of these directions as lines or planes that best fit the scattered data points.\n\nCreate new variables: PCA generates new variables, known as principal components, that align with these directions of variation. The first principal component captures the most variation in the data, the second component captures the remaining variation, and so on.\n\nSimplifying data: By using a smaller number of principal components, you can achieve dimensionality reduction. This means you can represent the data with fewer variables, making it easier to analyze and visualize.\n\nHowever, there is a trade-off. PCA discards some information to create this new, compressed set of variables. The key is to retain the components that hold the most significant information.\n\nPCA results are often displayed through biplots, which combine two types of plots: a score plot and a loadings plot.\n\nScore plot: This plot shows the data points projected onto the first two principal components. Each data point is represented as a dot, and its location reflects how it scores on those two components.\n\nLoadings plot: This plot illustrates the variables used in the PCA analysis. The variables are represented by arrows or lines radiating from the origin. The direction of an arrow indicates how a variable relates to the principal components, while the length of the arrow represents how much that variable contributes to the variation captured by each component.\n\nBy combining these two plots, a PCA biplot allows you to visualize both the relationships between the data points and the relationships between the variables. Here’s an example:\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Example results of Principal Component Analysis in the form of a biplot.\n\nImage source: \n\nBiplot for PCA Explained\n\nHere are some key aspects to consider when interpreting a PCA biplot:\n\nGrouping of Data Points: Observe whether the data points cluster or are spread out. Clusters indicate similar characteristics among those groups.\n\nDirection of Variable Arrows: Examine how the variable arrows relate. Are they pointing in similar directions (indicating a positive correlation) or opposite directions (indicating a negative correlation), or are they perpendicular (suggesting no correlation)?\n\nLength of Variable Arrows: The longer the arrow, the greater the variable’s contribution to the variation captured by that principal component.\n\nBy considering these elements of the biplot, you can gain valuable insights into the relationships between the variables and the overall structure of your data.\n\nIn essence, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a method for simplifying data by identifying the most important patterns and relationships among variables, thereby reducing the complexity of the dataset. It is a powerful tool utilized across various fields, including the sciences, engineering, humanities, and finance.\n\nExample of PCA Application in CZS\n\nRead \n\nGroundwater–surface water interactions in a lowland watershed: source contribution to stream flow - Guinn Garrett - 2012 - Hydrological Processes - Wiley Online Library\n\nConsider the following questions:\n\nWhat was the big-picture research question asked in this study?\n\nHow is the water balance affecting this stream system in the Charleston area?\n\nHow many potential water sources were identified for this stream system?\n\nHow was PCA used to separate the different sources and identify the more significant sources?\n\nWhat was determined to be the primary water source for such stream systems?\n\nSee \n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) Explained Visually with Zero Math | by Casey Cheng for a nice summary of the method.","type":"content","url":"/biogeochemistry#principal-component-analysis","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.1 Biogeochemistry in the CZ","lvl4":"t-test","lvl3":"Methods to Examine Inputs","lvl2":"What is Biogeochemistry?"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/biogeochemistry#t-test","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.1 Biogeochemistry in the CZ","lvl4":"t-test","lvl3":"Methods to Examine Inputs","lvl2":"What is Biogeochemistry?"},"content":"T-tests are statistical tools that compare the means of two groups within large data sets.

For example, you might use it to determine if Charleston’s precipitation differs from the national average.\n\nTwo-sample t-test: This test compares the means of two different groups. For instance, you might want to assess whether a new fertilizer increases corn yield compared to a standard fertilizer.\n\nHere’s a general overview of how a t-test works:\n\nSet up your hypothesis: You will formulate a null hypothesis, which is the idea you aim to disprove (typically that there is no difference between the means), and an alternative hypothesis, which suggests that there is a difference.\n\nCalculate the t-statistic: This statistic reflects the difference between the group means, the variability within the groups, and the sample sizes.\n\nFind the p-value: This value indicates the probability of obtaining a t-statistic as extreme as the one you calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Lower p-values suggest a smaller chance that the observed difference occurred randomly.\n\nInterpret the results: Choose a significance level (commonly set at 0.05) to determine if the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis. If it is, you can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the means.\n\nExample of t-test in environmental applications\n\nScenario: A geologist wants to investigate if there’s a difference in average lead concentration between roadside dust and soil samples collected further away from traffic in a city.\n\nNull hypothesis (H_0): The average lead concentration in roadside dust is the same as that in the soil further from traffic.\n\nAlternative hypothesis (H_1): The average lead concentration in roadside dust is higher than the average lead concentration in the soil further from traffic (due to traffic emissions).\n\nSteps:\n\nCollect data: The geologist randomly collects samples from both roadside areas and further away from traffic. They then measure the lead concentration in each sample.\n\nPerform the t-test: Using statistical software, the geologist runs an independent samples t-test on the lead concentration data for roadside dust and soil samples.\n\nAnalyze the results: The t-test will provide a t-statistic and a p-value. Let’s say the p-value is lower than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05).\n\nInterpretation: Since the p-value is statistically significant, we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the average lead concentration in roadside dust is statistically higher than in soil further from traffic. This supports the idea that traffic emissions contribute to higher lead levels in roadside dust.\n\nExample of t-test in critical zone sciences\n\nScenario: CZ researchers are interested in studying the effects of different land-use practices on soil carbon content. They collect soil samples from two sites: one with a forested area (Site A) and another with an agricultural field (Site B). They measure the soil carbon content (in g kg^{-1} of soil) at multiple locations within each site.\n\nThe researchers want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean soil carbon content between Site A and Site B. They can use a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two independent samples.\n\nLet’s assume the following data:\n\nSite A (Forested area):\nSoil carbon content (g kg^{-1}): 28.5, 31.2, 25.7, 29.9, 27.1, 30.4\nSample size, n_A=6\n\nSite B (Agricultural field):\nSoil carbon content (g kg^{-1}): 18.3, 20.1, 22.4, 19.7, 17.6, 21.2\nSample size, n_B=6\n\nThe researchers can perform a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean soil carbon content between the two sites against the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant difference.\n\nThe steps involved in performing the t-test would be:\n\nCalculate the sample means and standard deviations for each site. Data are shown above.\n\nSite A: Mean, x_A = 28.8 g kg^{-1}, Variance (SD), {s_A}^2 = 4.77\n\nSite B: Mean, x_B = 19.88 g kg^{-1}, Variance (SD), {s_B}^2 = 3.61\n\nCheck the assumptions of normality and equal variances.\n\nCalculate the t-statistic and degrees of freedom.\\begin{align}\nt &=& \\frac{x_A-x_B}{\\sqrt{{s_A}^2/n_A + {s_B}^2/n_B}}\\\\\n &=& \\frac{28.8-19.88}{\\sqrt{4.77/6 + 3.61/6}}\\\\\n &=& 6.38\n\\end{align}\n\nThe degrees of freedom (df) for this two-sample t-test would be calculated as:\\text{df} = n_A + n_B - 2 = 6 + 6 - 2 = 10\n\nDetermine the critical value from the t-distribution based on the chosen significance level (e.g., \\alpha = 0.05).\n\nCompare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value. With the t-statistic and degrees of freedom, the researchers can compare the calculated value to the critical value from the t-distribution table or use statistical software to determine the p-value and decide the null hypothesis.\n\nDecide to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the comparison. For example, if you have 10 degrees of freedom and want to test at a significance level of 0.05 (\\alpha = 0.05), the critical t-value from the table is 1.812. If your calculated t-statistic is greater than this critical value, you would reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThe calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical value; the researchers can conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean soil carbon content between the forested area and the agricultural field. This result might suggest that the land-use practices (forest versus agriculture) impact soil carbon content, and further investigations could be conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms.\n\nSee \n\nAn Introduction to t Tests | Definitions, Formula and Examples (scribbr.com)","type":"content","url":"/biogeochemistry#t-test","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.1 Biogeochemistry in the CZ","lvl4":"Stable Isotope Ratios","lvl3":"Methods to Examine Inputs","lvl2":"What is Biogeochemistry?"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/biogeochemistry#stable-isotope-ratios","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.1 Biogeochemistry in the CZ","lvl4":"Stable Isotope Ratios","lvl3":"Methods to Examine Inputs","lvl2":"What is Biogeochemistry?"},"content":"Stable isotopes do not spontaneously break down to form other isotopes.

Therefore, most elements used for stable isotope studies have a low atomic number and atomic mass (\n\nTable 1). For isotopes with an atomic mass of greater than 40, the relative mass differences are too small for any measurable isotopic fractionation.

This partitioning is proportional to the difference in the masses of the isotopes. The processes can either be equilibrium reactions, in which forward and backward reaction rates are equal for each isotope, or kinetic reactions, which are unidirectional reactions in which reaction rates depend on the masses of the isotopes and their vibrational energies.\n\nExample: Stable isotope fractionation of H_2O\n\nDuring evaporation of H_2O in a closed system, six isotope combinations of H_2O are possible: ^1H_2 ^{16}O, ^1H^2H^{16}O, ^2H_2^{16}O, ^1H_2^{18}O, ^1H^2H^{18}O, ^2H_2^{18}O.\n\nAs a result of these different stable isotope combinations, the molecular masses are 18, 19, 20, 20, 21, and 22 respectively. See the conceptualizations in the figure below.\n\nWhy do stable isotopes fractionate? Isotopically lighter isotopes have higher velocities than heavier isotopes. From basic physics, the kinetic energy of a particle can be calculated using the following formula:\\text{Kinetic Energy} = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n\nPer Eqn. \n\n(3), isotopically lighter molecules with higher velocities and, therefore, a greater amount of kinetic energy. Consider the above water example. Since the lighter molecules have greater velocities, they preferentially escape into the vapor phase, enriching the lighter isotopes ( and ) relative to the liquid phase of water. In addition, atoms with greater mass form slightly stronger bonds, and the heavier isotope is generally enriched in the more condensed phase or larger molecule.\n\nThe partitioning of stable isotopes between two substances, A and B, is described by the isotopic fractionation factor, \\alpha. The fractionation factor is written as\\alpha = \\frac{R_A}{R_B}\n\nwhere R is the ratio of heavy to light isotope abundance (e.g., ^2 H/^1 H, ^{18}O/^{16}O), generally, the isotope abundance ratio does not significantly vary in the environment, so the fractionation factor, \\alpha, generally has a value close to unity (1). However, this value can be precisely measured and expressed with a precision of 4-5 decimal places. The fractionation factor depends on the temperature and can be determined experimentally or from spectroscopic data.\n\nExample: Isotope fractionation factor\n\nConsider the evaporation of water. We can set the fractionation ratio and factor as follows:R = \\frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O}\n\nWe can calculate \\alpha as\\alpha = \\frac{^{18}O/^{16}O_{\\text{(liquid)}}}{^{18}O/^{16}O_{\\text{(vapor)}}}\n\nSince ^{16}O is enriched in the vapor phase relative to the liquid,[^{18}O]_{\\text{vapor}} > [^{16}O]_{\\text{liquid}}\n\nConversely, ^{18}O is enriched in the liquid relative to the vapor,[^{18}O]_{\\text{liquid}} > [^{18}O]_{\\text{vapor}}\n\nTherefore, the fractionation factor is greater than 1. With increasing temperature, the fractionation factor decreases and becomes 1 at infinite temperature.\n\nIn \n\nFigure 3, isotope fractionation of O as a function of temperature during evaporation of H_2O is shown. Paleoclimatologists use O ratios (^{18}O/^{16}O) from H_2O trapped in glaciers as well as the O absorbed in the shells of marine plants and animals to measure past temperatures and rainfall. In polar ice cores, the measurement is relatively simple: less ^{18}O in the frozen water means that temperatures were cooler.  In shells, the measurement is far more complicated because the biological and chemical processes that form the shells skew the O ratio in different ways depending on temperature.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Water vapor gradually loses ^{18}O as it travels from the equator to the poles. Because water molecules with heavy ^{18}O isotopes in them condense more quickly than normal water molecules, the air becomes progressively depleted in ^{18}O as it travels to high latitudes and becomes colder and drier. The snow that forms most glacial ice is also depleted in ^{18}O.

A prime example of this connection is the exchange of carbon (C) between heterotrophs and autotrophs, facilitated by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO_2). Autotrophs utilize CO_2 as a fundamental building block to create multi-carbon, high-energy compounds like glucose. These organisms harness energy from the Sun to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together, storing this energy for later use in processes such as respiration.\n\nMost terrestrial autotrophs directly obtain CO_2 from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in dissolved forms, such as bicarbonate (HCO_3 ^-). Regardless of the method of acquisition, a byproduct of carbon fixation in these organic compounds is oxygen (O_2). Photosynthetic organisms are responsible for maintaining approximately 21% of the oxygen content in the atmosphere that we observe today.\n\nIn this biological carbon exchange, heterotrophs—particularly primary consumers like herbivores—play a crucial role. Heterotrophs obtain high-energy carbon compounds by consuming autotrophs and breaking them down through respiration to generate cellular energy, such as ATP. Aerobic respiration is the most efficient form of respiration, which requires oxygen from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. Consequently, there is a continuous exchange of O_2 and CO_2 between autotrophs, which need carbon, and heterotrophs, which require oxygen.\n\nAutotrophs also engage in respiration, consuming the organic molecules they produce. They utilize O_2 and release CO_2. However, they produce more oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis than they consume for respiration. This surplus oxygen is available for the respiration of other aerobic organisms.

Carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon reservoirs. These include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediments, soil, rocks (including fossil fuels), and Earth’s interior.\n\nThe atmosphere serves as a major carbon reservoir, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide (CO_2), which is essential for the process of photosynthesis. The levels of CO_2 in the atmosphere are significantly influenced by the carbon stored in the oceans. The carbon exchange between the atmosphere and water reservoirs affects how much carbon is found in each, creating a reciprocal relationship. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in water and, unlike oxygen and nitrogen gas, reacts with water molecules to form ionic compounds. Some of these ions combine with Ca^{2+} in seawater to form calcium carbonate (CaCO_3), a significant component of marine organisms’ shells. Over geologic time, CaCO_3 accumulates to form limestone, the largest carbon reservoir on Earth.\n\nOn land, carbon is stored in the soil as organic carbon, resulting from the decomposition of living organisms and the weathering of terrestrial rocks and minerals. Beneath the surface, both on land and at sea, fossil fuels are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of plant remains over millions of years. Fossil fuels are considered non-renewable because their consumption far exceeds their formation rate. A non-renewable resource is regenerated very slowly or not at all. Carbon can also enter the atmosphere from land (including the seabed) through volcanic eruptions and other geothermal processes. Carbon sediments from the ocean floor are transported deep within Earth by subduction, the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. Carbon is released as CO_2 during volcanic eruptions or from hydrothermal vents.\n\nAdditionally, human practices in animal husbandry add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The large number of livestock raised to feed Earth’s growing human population contributes to increased CO_2 levels resulting from their respiration. This exemplifies how human activities indirectly impact biogeochemical cycles in significant ways. While much of the debate regarding the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change centers on fossil fuels, scientists consider natural processes—such as volcanic activity, plant growth, soil carbon levels, and respiration—when modeling and predicting the future impacts of rising CO_2 levels.","type":"content","url":"/biogeochemicalcycles#the-biogeochemical-carbon-cycle","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles","lvl2":"The Nitrogen Cycle"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/biogeochemicalcycles#the-nitrogen-cycle","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles","lvl2":"The Nitrogen Cycle"},"content":"The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical process through which nitrogen (N) is transformed into various chemical forms as it moves through the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. The primary forms of nitrogen include gaseous dinitrogen (N_2), ammonia (NH_3), ammonium (NH_4 ^+), and nitrate (NO_3 ^-).\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Nitrogen enters the living world from the atmosphere through nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This nitrogen and nitrogenous waste from animals is then processed back into gaseous nitrogen by soil bacteria, which also supply terrestrial food webs with the organic nitrogen they need.\n\nImage source: \n\n20.2 Biogeochemical Cycles - Concepts of Biology | OpenStax\n\nGetting nitrogen into the living world is a challenging process. Plants and phytoplankton cannot directly utilize nitrogen from the atmosphere, which exists as the tightly bonded, triple covalent molecule N_2. Despite comprising approximately 78% of the atmosphere, this gaseous nitrogen needs to be processed to be helpful in living organisms. Nitrogen enters the biosphere primarily through free-living and symbiotic bacteria that incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules via nitrogen fixation, which converts N_2 into a usable form.\n\nCyanobacteria, which inhabit most sunlight-rich aquatic ecosystems, play a critical role in this nitrogen fixation process. They can utilize inorganic nitrogen sources to “fix” nitrogen. Additionally, the bacteria known as Rhizobium live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and supply these plants with the organic nitrogen they require. Free-living bacteria like Azotobacter are also significant contributors to nitrogen fixation.\n\nOrganic nitrogen is vital for understanding ecosystem dynamics, as many ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition, are limited by nitrogen availability. Once nitrogen is fixed into living organisms, it eventually undergoes conversion back into nitrogen gas through the actions of bacteria in a series of steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The process begins with ammonification, where specific bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste from living animals or decaying organisms into ammonium (NH_4 ^+). Next, nitrifying bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas, convert this ammonium into nitrites (NO_2 ^-) through nitrification. Subsequently, similar bacteria transform these nitrites into nitrates (NO_3 ^-). Finally, denitrification occurs, where bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing them to re-enter the atmosphere.\n\nHuman activities can also introduce nitrogen into the environment, mainly through the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases various nitrogen oxides, and the application of artificial fertilizers that contain nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in agriculture. These fertilizers can wash into lakes, streams, and rivers due to surface runoff. Atmospheric nitrogen (aside from N_2) is linked to several ecological effects, including the formation of acid rain (as nitric acid, HNO_3) and greenhouse gas effects (as nitrous oxide, N_2O), which could contribute to climate change. A significant consequence of fertilizer runoff is the process of eutrophication in both freshwater and saltwater systems, wherein nutrient over-enrichment leads to excessive algae growth, causing a range of environmental problems.\n\nIn the marine nitrogen cycle, a similar set of processes—ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification—takes place and is conducted by marine bacteria and archaea. Some of this nitrogen ultimately settles on the ocean floor as sediment, which may be transferred to land over geological time due to the uplift of Earth’s surface, thereby becoming part of terrestrial rock. Although the direct movement of nitrogen from rocks into living systems has traditionally been viewed as insignificant compared to atmospheric nitrogen fixation, recent studies suggest that this process may be significant and should be included in any comprehensive analysis of the global nitrogen cycle.","type":"content","url":"/biogeochemicalcycles#the-nitrogen-cycle","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles","lvl2":"The Phosphorus Cycle"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/biogeochemicalcycles#the-phosphorus-cycle","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles","lvl2":"The Phosphorus Cycle"},"content":"Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a significant component of nucleic acids and phospholipids and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones.

In addition to human activities, natural surface runoff occurs when phosphates are leached from phosphate-containing rocks due to weathering, sending these phosphates into rivers, lakes, and oceans. These rocks have origins in the ocean, where phosphate-containing sediments primarily form from the bodies and excretions of marine organisms. Additionally, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust can contribute significantly to PO_4 ^{3-} sources. Over geological time, this sediment is transported to land by uplifting the Earth’s surface.\n\nPhosphorus is also exchanged between PO_4 ^{3-} dissolved in the ocean and marine organisms. The movement of PO_4 ^{3-} from the ocean to land and through soil is extremely slow, with an average oceanic residence time of PO_4 ^{3-} ranging between 20,000 and 100,000 years.\n\nThe phosphorus cycle is relatively slow, taking millions of years to move from one reservoir to another. The main reservoirs of phosphorus include rocks, sediments, soil, and living organisms. Most phosphorus in nature exists in the form of PO_4 ^{3-}.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:In nature, phosphorus exists as the phosphate ion (PO_4 ^{3-}). Weathering of rocks and volcanic activity releases phosphate into the soil, water, and air, where it becomes available to terrestrial food webs. Phosphate enters the oceans through surface runoff, groundwater, and river flow. Phosphate dissolved in ocean water cycles into marine food webs. Some phosphate from the marine food webs falls to the ocean floor, forming sediment.\n\nImage source: \n\n20.2 Biogeochemical Cycles - Concepts of Biology | OpenStax\n\nExcess phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) entering ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and sewage lead to excessive algae growth. When these algae die and decay, they deplete dissolved oxygen (O_2) in the water, resulting in the death of aquatic organisms, such as shellfish and finfish. This process contributes to the formation of dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of major rivers, resulting in massive fish kills, particularly during the summer months.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:The size and number of marine dead zones—areas where the deep water is so low in dissolved oxygen that sea creatures can’t survive—have grown explosively in the past half-century. Yellow circles on this map show the location of observed eutrophic zones. Red dots show where hypoxic zones have been observed. It’s no coincidence that dead zones occur downriver of places where land is intensively used for agriculture. Some fertilizer we apply to crops is washed into streams and rivers. Fertilizer-laden runoff triggers explosive planktonic algae growth in coastal areas. The algae die and rain down into deep waters, where their remains are like fertilizer for microbes. The microbes decompose the organic matter, using up the oxygen. Mass killing of fish and other sea life often results. Satellites can observe changes in how the ocean surface reflects and absorbs sunlight when the water holds a lot of particles of organic matter. Darker blues in this image show higher concentrations of particulate organic matter, indicating the overly fertile waters that can culminate in dead zones.\n\nImage source: \n\nCoastal Dead Zones (nasa.gov)\n\nA dead zone is an area in lakes and oceans near the mouths of rivers where large regions are periodically depleted of their normal flora and fauna; these zones can be caused by eutrophication, oil spills, dumping of toxic chemicals, and other human activities. The number of dead zones has increased for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008. One of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico: fertilizer runoff from the Mississippi River basin created a dead zone of over 8,463 square miles. Phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems, including the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.","type":"content","url":"/biogeochemicalcycles#the-phosphorus-cycle","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles","lvl2":"Nutrient Pollution"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/biogeochemicalcycles#nutrient-pollution","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.2 Biogeochemical Cycles","lvl2":"Nutrient Pollution"},"content":"Nutrient pollution is the addition of excess nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, into the water or air.\n\nAccording to US EPA, \"nutrient pollution is one of America’s most widespread, costly and challenging environmental problems.” (\n\nNutrient Pollution | US EPA)\n\n\n\nNitrogen and phosphorus are natural nutrients found in aquatic ecosystems. Nitrogen is the most abundant element in the air we breathe. Both nitrogen and phosphorus support the growth of algae and aquatic plants, which provide food and habitat for fish, shellfish, and smaller organisms living in water.\n\nHowever, when excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus enter the environment - often due to various human activities - air and water can become polluted. Over the past several decades, nutrient pollution has affected many streams, rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters, leading to serious environmental and human health issues and economic impacts.\n\nAn overabundance of nitrogen and phosphorus in water leads to accelerated algae growth, which can overwhelm ecosystems. Significant increases in algae harm water quality, disrupt food resources and habitats, and decrease the oxygen needed for fish and other aquatic life to survive. Large algae outbreaks are known as algal blooms, which can drastically reduce or eliminate oxygen in the water, causing illnesses in fish and resulting in significant fish die-offs. Some algal blooms produce harmful toxins and encourage bacterial growth, posing health risks to humans through contact with contaminated water, consuming tainted fish or shellfish, or drinking polluted water.\n\nNutrient pollution in groundwater - used as a drinking water source by millions of people in the United States - can be harmful even at low levels. Infants are particularly vulnerable to a nitrogen-based compound called nitrates found in drinking water. Excess nitrogen in the atmosphere can create pollutants such as ammonia and ozone, impairing respiratory health, limiting visibility, and disrupting plant growth. When excess nitrogen falls back to Earth from the atmosphere, it can negatively affect the health of forests, soils, and waterways.\n\nThe primary sources of excess nitrogen and phosphorus are:\n\nAgriculture: The nitrogen and phosphorus in animal manure and chemical fertilizers are necessary to grow crops. However, when plants do not fully utilize these nutrients they can be lost from the farm fields and negatively impact air and downstream water quality.\n\nStormwater: When precipitation falls on our cities and towns, it runs across hard surfaces - like rooftops, sidewalks, and roads - and carries pollutants, including nitrogen and phosphorus, into local waterways.\n\nWastewater: Our sewer and septic systems are responsible for treating large quantities of waste, and these systems do not always operate properly or remove enough nitrogen and phosphorus before discharging into waterways.\n\nFossil Fuels: Electric power generation, industry, transportation, and agriculture have increased the amount of nitrogen in the air through the use of fossil fuels.\n\nIn and Around the Home: Fertilizers, yard and pet waste, and certain soaps and detergents contain nitrogen and phosphorus and can contribute to nutrient pollution if not properly used or disposed of. The amount of hard surfaces and landscaping type can also increase nitrogen and phosphorus runoff during wet weather.\n\nExcess nutrients in air and water can affect human health, the environment, and the economy.

Some of the most common human impacts on the CZ include:\n\nDeforestation: This refers to clearing trees from an area, which can lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss.\n\nAgriculture: While essential for food production, agriculture can negatively affect the CZ. Using fertilizers and pesticides may contaminate soil and water, and clearing land for farming contributes to deforestation.\n\nMining: Mining disrupts the natural processes of the CZ. The extraction of minerals can pollute soil and water, and the construction of mines can damage landscapes.\n\nUrbanization: The growth of cities, or urbanization, often leads to the loss of natural habitats, soil and water contamination, and an increased risk of flooding.\n\nClimate Change: This global threat significantly impacts the CZ. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns lead to soil erosion, water shortages, and more frequent extreme weather events.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will:\n\nlearn about the impacts that humans have on the CZ,\n\nthe different types of impacts, and\n\nmitigation strategies for slowing these impacts","type":"content","url":"/climatecz","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl2":"Deforestation and Agriculture"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/climatecz#deforestation-and-agriculture","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl2":"Deforestation and Agriculture"},"content":"Agricultural activities, encompassing both crop cultivation and livestock grazing, represent a dominant force reshaping the terrestrial CZ.Croplands and pastures have expanded to the extent that they now rival natural forests as the major biome covering the Earth’s land surface.Globally, over one-third of the world’s land surface and nearly three-quarters of accessible freshwater resources are now dedicated to crop or livestock production. Agricultural land currently spans approximately 38% of the planet’s ice-free land area.\n\nModern agriculture is often characterized by intensification practices aimed at increasing yields, including the widespread use of synthetic chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides), extensive irrigation systems, and mechanical tillage. Since the mid-20th century, for instance, global use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer has increased nearly ninefold, and the amount of water used for irrigation has roughly doubled.\n\nThese practices have significant consequences for the CZ. Land conversion for agriculture is the primary driver of habitat loss globally. Agricultural activities contribute substantially to soil degradation through processes like erosion (accelerated by tillage and removal of cover), compaction (from heavy machinery), loss of soil organic matter, and depletion or imbalance of essential nutrients. Agriculture is also a major consumer of water resources through irrigation and a significant source of water pollution via runoff containing excess nutrients and pesticide residues. These impacts collectively alter fundamental biogeochemical cycles within the CZ.\n\nDeforestation, the clearing or significant thinning of forests for conversion to other land uses, is another major anthropogenic pressure on the CZ. The primary driver of deforestation globally is the expansion of agriculture, including clearing land for crops like soy and palm oil, and for cattle ranching. Other significant drivers include logging operations (both legal and illegal) for timber and wood products, the development of infrastructure such as roads and cities, mining activities, and the use of fire, both intentionally for land clearing and unintentionally through wildfires, which can be exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe removal of forest cover has profound impacts on CZ processes. It leads to direct habitat loss and fragmentation, causing significant declines in biodiversity. The loss of protective tree canopy and root systems exposes soil to the direct impact of rain and wind, leading to greatly accelerated soil erosion rates.15 Deforestation disrupts local and regional water cycles by altering evapotranspiration rates and reducing infiltration, often leading to changes in precipitation patterns and river flows, and diminished water quality. Furthermore, forests act as major carbon sinks; their removal not only eliminates this carbon uptake capacity but also releases large amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere through burning and decomposition, contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions (estimated at 7-10% of the human total) and exacerbating climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\nSoil erosion: Trees and their roots help to hold soil in place, and when they are removed, the soil is more susceptible to erosion. This can increase sedimentation in rivers and streams, harming aquatic ecosystems and reducing water quality.\n\nChanges in the water cycle: Trees play a critical role in the water cycle by intercepting rainfall, reducing runoff, and increasing infiltration. Deforestation can impact these processes, leading to more flooding and droughts and altering the timing and amount of water that reaches streams and rivers.\n\nLoss of biodiversity: Forests are home to many species of plants and animals, and their removal can lead to biodiversity loss. This can have cascading effects on the CZ, as different species play essential roles in nutrient cycling, pollination, and other ecosystem processes.\n\nSoil nutrient depletion: Forests play a critical role in cycling nutrients, and their removal can lead to soil nutrient depletion. This can reduce soil fertility and make growing more difficult for plants.\n\nIncreased greenhouse gas emissions: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass and soil. Deforestation can increase greenhouse gas emissions, as carbon stored in trees and soils is released into the atmosphere.\n\nDeforestation can significantly impact the CZ, affecting water, soil, biodiversity, and the global climate.","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#deforestation-and-agriculture","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/climatecz#urbanization","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"content":"Urbanization involves the expansion of cities, towns, and associated infrastructure, including residential areas, commercial buildings, industrial facilities, and transportation networks (roads, highways).

This altered hydrology contributes to increased flood risk, reduced groundwater recharge, and changes in stream channel morphology and flow regimes. Urban areas are also major sources of pollution, including municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, contaminants carried in stormwater runoff (heavy metals, hydrocarbons, nutrients, litter), and air pollutants. Soil within urban areas often suffers from sealing, compaction, contamination, and physical disruption.

As noted previously, estimates suggest that between 30% and 50% of the global land surface has been transformed by human activities, primarily through the conversion of natural ecosystems like forests and grasslands into agricultural lands (croplands and pastures) and urban settlements. These transformations fundamentally alter the surface characteristics of the CZ, directly influencing key hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration (ET), water infiltration into the soil, and surface runoff generation. They also profoundly impact biogeochemical cycles, particularly those of carbon and nutrients.

Natural vegetation, particularly forests with extensive root systems and protective litter layers, generally promotes high infiltration rates. Deforestation and conversion to agriculture often lead to reduced infiltration due to soil compaction, loss of soil structure, reduced organic matter, and the absence of deep root channels.3 Conventional tillage, in particular, can create surface crusts and reduce pore continuity, hindering water entry.26 Urbanization has the most dramatic effect, as impervious surfaces like pavement and rooftops essentially eliminate infiltration, forcing nearly all precipitation to become surface runoff. Conversely, practices like afforestation (planting trees) or adopting no-till agriculture with cover crops can enhance infiltration rates.\n\nThe consequence of reduced infiltration is a corresponding increase in the volume, rate, and peak flow of surface runoff. Studies modeling future land use scenarios with increased urbanization project significant increases in total surface runoff and streamflow. This shift in hydrology has multiple repercussions: it increases the risk and severity of flooding downstream; it reduces the amount of water recharging underlying aquifers, potentially impacting groundwater availability; it contributes to accelerated soil erosion by increasing the transport capacity of overland flow; and it alters the overall water balance of watersheds. This fundamental alteration of water pathways – shifting from subsurface flow-dominated systems towards surface runoff-dominated systems – is a key consequence of LULC change with cascading effects throughout the CZ.","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#altered-hydrology","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Soil degradation","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/climatecz#soil-degradation","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Soil degradation","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"content":"Natural soil formation is an exceedingly slow process, occurring over geological timescales. In contrast, many human land uses, particularly intensive agriculture and urbanization, can lead to rapid soil degradation, defined as a negative trend in land condition expressed as a long-term reduction or loss of biological productivity, ecological integrity, or value to humans.\n\nAgricultural practices are major contributors to soil degradation. Conventional tillage, which involves mechanically disturbing the soil, breaks down soil aggregates, reduces organic matter content, and leaves the soil surface vulnerable. Continuous cultivation without adequate replenishment of organic matter or nutrients can lead to nutrient mining and a decline in soil fertility. Studies comparing agricultural land with natural vegetation often show significant declines in soil organic carbon (SOC) or total organic carbon (TOC), magnesium, boron, iron, and total nitrogen under long-term cultivation.15 Overgrazing by livestock can also lead to soil compaction and loss of vegetative cover, further exacerbating degradation. Urbanization contributes to soil degradation primarily through soil sealing by impervious surfaces (buildings, pavement), which eliminates soil functions entirely in those areas, as well as through compaction during construction and physical disruption of soil profiles.\n\nSoil erosion, the detachment and transport of soil particles by wind or water, is a natural process, but its rate is dramatically accelerated by many human land use practices. The removal of protective vegetation cover, a hallmark of deforestation and conversion to agriculture, leaves the soil surface directly exposed to the erosive forces of rainfall impact and surface runoff. Agricultural tillage disrupts the soil’s natural structure, breaking down aggregates that help resist erosion and reducing surface residue cover that dissipates raindrop energy. Similarly, overgrazing reduces plant cover and trampling compacts the soil, both increasing susceptibility to erosion.\n\nThe magnitude of human impact on erosion is substantial. In the United States, soil loss rates on some croplands and pastures have been measured at over 1 centimeter per year, a rate that vastly exceeds natural soil formation rates, leading to a net loss of soil capital. Globally, it has been estimated that roughly half of the planet’s topsoil has been lost over the last 150 years due to erosion and other forms of \n\ndegradation.Land degradation, with erosion as a key component, currently affects over a quarter of the Earth’s ice-free land area.\n\nThe consequences of accelerated erosion are far-reaching. It leads to the loss of fertile topsoil, which contains the bulk of organic matter and nutrients, thereby reducing agricultural productivity and potentially threatening food security. The eroded sediment is transported into streams, rivers, and lakes, causing sedimentation that clogs waterways, degrades aquatic habitats, and reduces water storage capacity in reservoirs. Eroded sediment often carries attached pollutants, such as nutrients (phosphorus) and pesticides, further impairing water quality.","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#soil-degradation","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Changes in biogeochemical cycling","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/climatecz#changes-in-biogeochemical-cycling","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Changes in biogeochemical cycling","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"content":"Natural ecosystems typically exhibit relatively closed nutrient cycles, where nutrients taken up by plants are returned to the soil through litter decomposition. Land use changes disrupt these cycles profoundly. Deforestation removes the significant nutrient pool held in biomass and eliminates the continuous input of nutrients via litterfall. Increased runoff following deforestation can also flush nutrients out of the system.\n\nAgriculture fundamentally alters nutrient cycling through the removal of nutrients in harvested crops and the addition of external inputs like synthetic fertilizers and manures. Continuous cropping without adequate nutrient replacement or fallow periods can lead to the depletion or “mining” of soil nutrient stocks, including essential macro- and micronutrients. Conversely, the overuse or inefficient management of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers often leads to nutrient surpluses in the soil. These excess nutrients can cause soil acidification (associated with some nitrogen fertilizers), create imbalances that affect plant uptake of other nutrients, and are readily lost to the environment via runoff and leaching.\n\nThe consequences of disrupted nutrient cycles include declines in soil fertility and long-term agricultural productivity due to the loss of organic matter and essential elements. Nutrient losses from agricultural and urban landscapes are a primary cause of eutrophication in downstream aquatic ecosystems, leading to harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion (hypoxia or “dead zones”), fish kills, and loss of biodiversity. Land use change, particularly through agriculture, is recognized as a critical driver altering global nutrient cycles, with significant environmental repercussions. The health of the soil itself, including its structure, organic matter content, and microbial communities, is central to regulating these processes. Practices that degrade soil health simultaneously exacerbate erosion, reduce infiltration, and disrupt nutrient cycling, while soil-building practices offer co-benefits across these functions. Furthermore, the impacts of LULC are often persistent, creating legacy effects that influence CZ structure, function, and resilience long after the initial change, making degraded systems more vulnerable to future disturbances like climate change.","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#changes-in-biogeochemical-cycling","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Heat island effects","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/climatecz#heat-island-effects","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Heat island effects","lvl2":"Urbanization"},"content":"Urbanization can increase city temperatures, as buildings and pavement absorb and retain heat.

The primary driver is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs)—principally carbon dioxide (CO_2), methane (CH_4), and nitrous oxide (N_2O)—resulting from the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial processes, deforestation, and agricultural practices. Since the pre-industrial period (roughly 1850-1900), these activities have caused global average surface temperature to increase by approximately 1.1°C (as of 2011-2020). Atmospheric concentrations of CO_2, CH_4, and N_2O have reached levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years.\n\nImportantly, warming is not uniform across the globe; land areas are warming significantly faster than the global average, particularly in high-latitude regions. Climate models project continued warming throughout the 21st century under all emission scenarios, with global temperature expected to reach or exceed 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels within the coming decades. Climate change, however, encompasses far more than just rising average temperatures. It involves fundamental shifts in the climate system, including alterations in precipitation patterns (amount, intensity, seasonality), an intensification of the global water cycle, more frequent and intense extreme weather events (heat waves, heavy rainfall, droughts), rising sea levels, and widespread changes in the cryosphere (glaciers, snow cover, permafrost). These pervasive changes act as powerful modifiers of Critical Zone processes worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of climate change on the CZ (climate zone) is the alteration of precipitation patterns. As the climate warms, some regions are experiencing more intense rainfall events, while others face prolonged droughts. These changes can affect soil erosion rates, nutrient cycling, and water availability, all of which influence the health and productivity of ecosystems in the CZ.\n\nClimate change can also reshape vegetation cover in the CZ. Variations in temperature and precipitation can shift the ranges of plant species, with some plants being better adapted to the new climate conditions than others. This shift can lead to changes in the composition and productivity of vegetation in the CZ, further affecting other ecological processes.\n\nMoreover, climate change can disrupt biogeochemical cycles within the CZ. For instance, changes in temperature and precipitation can influence nutrient cycling and carbon storage rates, ultimately impacting the overall health and productivity of the ecosystem. These effects can significantly threaten the long-term sustainability of the CZ and the ecosystem services it provides to humans, including clean water and food production.","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#climate-change","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl2":"The Anthropocene"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/climatecz#the-anthropocene","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl2":"The Anthropocene"},"content":"The term “Anthropocene” gained significant traction in the scientific community and beyond. The term was coined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer (\n\nsee The ‘Anthropocene’ (2000) | SpringerLink and \n\nGeology of mankind). While the term itself was coined earlier, it was Crutzen and Stoermer’s proposal that humanity had entered a new geological epoch due to its profound impact on the planet that resonated widely. The core idea behind the Anthropocene is that human activities have become the primary driver shaping the Earth’s systems, to such an extent that they now rival the forces of natural geophysical processes. This influence has intensified significantly since the mid-20th century, a period often referred to as the “Great Acceleration,” marked by an unprecedented surge in population growth, industrialization, and globalization. See\n\nThe Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch that marks the impact of human activities on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. It is characterized by the significant changes in the Earth’s geology and ecosystems caused by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.  The Anthropocene era is still a topic of debate among scientists and geologists.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:There is no consensus on when the Anthropocene era began, but there is some consensus that humans are agents of geologic change.\n\nImage source: \n\nWhat Is the Anthropocene? - Eos\n\nFor your reference see the different depictions of geologic time scales below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:The geologic time scale, proportionally represented as a log-spiral with some major events in Earth’s history.

The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), tasked with evaluating the evidence, proposed a start date around 1950 CE, using the sharp upturn in plutonium levels resulting from nuclear weapons testing as a primary marker. However, in March 2024, the ICS Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) voted against this proposal, a decision later confirmed by the ICS and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The rejection was largely attributed to concerns about the relatively shallow sedimentary record associated with such a recent start date and whether the proposed marker met the stringent criteria for defining a new epoch. An alternative perspective suggests defining the Anthropocene not as a formal epoch but as an ongoing “geological event,” which might better reflect the complex and potentially diachronous nature of human impacts.\n\nThe critical zone, defined as the Earth’s permeable near-surface layer “from the tops of the trees to the bottom of the groundwater,” is profoundly affected by the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene era is defined within the context of the critical zone in the following ways:\n\nDominant Human Influence: The defining characteristic of the Anthropocene in the critical zone is the overwhelming impact of human activities on its composition, structure, and functioning. Natural processes within the critical zone are now inextricably linked with and often overridden by anthropogenic forces.\n\nKey Anthropogenic Drivers and Their Impacts:\n\nLand-use Change: Activities like agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, and mining drastically alter the physical structure of the critical zone. This leads to soil erosion, habitat fragmentation, changes in water infiltration and storage, and altered biogeochemical cycles.\n\nClimate Change: Human-induced climate change affects temperature and precipitation patterns, leading to altered weathering rates, changes in vegetation cover, increased frequency of extreme events (like droughts and floods), and impacts on water availability within the critical zone.\n\nPollution: The introduction of various pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, industrial chemicals) into the atmosphere, water, and soil directly contaminates the critical zone, affecting its biological and chemical processes and threatening the health of ecosystems and human populations.\n\nAltered Biogeochemical Cycles: Human activities, particularly the industrial fixation of nitrogen and the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly altered global nutrient cycles (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon). This leads to eutrophication of water bodies, soil acidification, and changes in atmospheric composition, all of which cascade through the critical zone.\n\nBiodiversity Loss: Habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change driven by human actions are causing unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss within the critical zone, weakening ecosystem resilience and altering critical zone processes.\n\nGeomorphic Changes: Human activities such as dam construction, river channelization, and large-scale excavation have become significant geomorphic agents, rivaling or exceeding natural rates of erosion and sedimentation within the critical zone.\n\nThe “Anthropogenic Critical Zone”: Recognizing the profound and pervasive influence of humans, the concept of the “Anthropogenic Critical Zone” has emerged. This perspective emphasizes the need to study the critical zone not as a purely natural system but as one deeply intertwined with human activities and the “technosphere” (human-built infrastructure and technology).","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#the-anthropocene","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Implications for Critical Zone Science:","lvl2":"The Anthropocene"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/climatecz#implications-for-critical-zone-science","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"Implications for Critical Zone Science:","lvl2":"The Anthropocene"},"content":"Critical zone science in the Anthropocene requires a transdisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge from earth sciences, ecology, social sciences, and the humanities to understand the complex interactions between human actions and critical zone processes.\n\nResearch focuses on quantifying the impacts of human activities on critical zone fluxes (water, carbon, nutrients, sediment) and understanding how these changes affect essential ecosystem services like food production, water quality, and carbon sequestration.\n\nThere is a growing emphasis on incorporating human agency and local knowledge into critical zone research and management to address environmental challenges effectively.\n\nIn essence, the Anthropocene defines a state where the critical zone’s development, function, and future trajectory are no longer governed primarily by natural forces but are increasingly shaped by human activities, demanding a new paradigm for understanding and managing this life-sustaining layer of our planet.","type":"content","url":"/climatecz#implications-for-critical-zone-science","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"The Anthrocene Epoch","lvl2":"The Anthropocene"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/climatecz#the-anthrocene-epoch","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.2 Anthropogenic Impacts","lvl3":"The Anthrocene Epoch","lvl2":"The Anthropocene"},"content":"The Anthropocene is NOT yet formally recognized as an official epoch within the Geologic Time Scale by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).

This coincides with a period known as the “Great Acceleration,” marked by significant increases in human population, industrial activity, resource consumption, and environmental impact, including the presence of nuclear fallout in geological strata.\n\nAlternative Proposed Dates: While 1950 is a leading proposal, other start dates have been suggested, ranging from the beginning of agriculture to the Industrial Revolution.\n\n“Golden Spike”: The AWG proposed Crawford Lake in Canada as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), or “golden spike,” to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene in the geological record, characterized by specific markers in the lake sediments dating to around 1950.

However, while engaging in daily activities, humans impact the natural processes of the CZ upon which they depend. These impacts often necessitate changes in both attitudes and actions to address the resulting effects on the environment. In this module, we will further explore how geoscientists study the processes in the CZ and the interactions between natural processes and human activities that influence them. We will also look into the strategies and methods developed by geoscientists and engineers to mitigate disruptions to these natural systems while considering the social and economic impacts on individuals and communities.\n\nHumans affect the CZ in numerous ways, and it faces increasing pressure from human activities such as land use intensification, global environmental changes, and expanding consumption patterns. Activities like deforestation, mining, agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization can disrupt CZ processes and functions. For example, deforestation can lead to soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter, reducing soil fertility and productivity. Mining can cause soil compaction and contamination with heavy metals. Agriculture may result in soil degradation due to excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Urbanization can lead to soil sealing and loss of vegetation cover, while industrialization may contribute to air pollution that adversely affects soil health.\n\nThe impacts of human actions on the CZ are complex and multifaceted. It is crucial to understand these impacts to develop strategies for the sustainable management of this critical zone.\n\nWe will design and implement strategies to address human-related environmental impacts while considering their effects on communities. Specifically, we will examine issues such as climate change, land-use change, access to clean water, and universal food security.
