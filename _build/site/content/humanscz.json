However, while engaging in daily activities, humans impact the natural processes of the CZ upon which they depend. These impacts often necessitate changes in both attitudes and actions to address the resulting effects on the environment. In this module, we will further explore how geoscientists study the processes in the CZ and the interactions between natural processes and human activities that influence them. We will also look into the strategies and methods developed by geoscientists and engineers to mitigate disruptions to these natural systems while considering the social and economic impacts on individuals and communities.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"key":"mmGYM2kWim"}],"key":"IDGrJSXcFS"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Humans affect the CZ in numerous ways, and it faces increasing pressure from human activities such as land use intensification, global environmental changes, and expanding consumption patterns. Activities like deforestation, mining, agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization can disrupt CZ processes and functions. For example, deforestation can lead to soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter, reducing soil fertility and productivity. Mining can cause soil compaction and contamination with heavy metals. Agriculture may result in soil degradation due to excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Urbanization can lead to soil sealing and loss of vegetation cover, while industrialization may contribute to air pollution that adversely affects soil health.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"m0fjiImXvA"}],"key":"WCtGgaQ7F8"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The impacts of human actions on the CZ are complex and multifaceted.
