This field of study examines how these components interact and transform over time. The biogeochemical processes within the CZ are essential for regulating nutrient cycling and energy flow, which are vital for sustaining terrestrial life, including that of humans. Insights gained from biogeochemistry can contribute to addressing significant challenges facing humanity, such as climate change and environmental stability.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"key":"s93UgODiaV"}],"key":"dFI6TnjPz0"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This module explores the integrated roles of biology, geology, and chemistry in the CZ, with an emphasis on its biogeochemical functions.
