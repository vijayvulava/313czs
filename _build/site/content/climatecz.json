However, in March 2024, the ICS Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) voted against this proposal, a decision later confirmed by the ICS and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The rejection was largely attributed to concerns about the relatively shallow sedimentary record associated with such a recent start date and whether the proposed marker met the stringent criteria for defining a new epoch.
