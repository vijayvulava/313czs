Some experienced and respected Earth surface and environmental scientists have expressed doubts about the legitimacy of CZ science, suggesting that its inquiries and observations resemble those found in soil and ecosystem science. However, a key distinction between these fields and CZ science is its emphasis on depth into the subsurface and across extensive geological timeframes. CZ scientists incorporate “deep thinking” into their research, meaning a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of geology and geosciences is essential to fully appreciate and comprehend CZ science.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"key":"av0jLIgbo0"}],"key":"aJv6WynCB5"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The overlapping spheres are essential for facilitating various physical, chemical, and biological processes within the Critical Zone (CZ) and for shaping it.
