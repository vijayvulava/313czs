However, the concept of extinction took some time to gain acceptance among the majority. The main reason for this hesitance was that the most well-known fossils were marine invertebrates. While these fossils are just as valid as terrestrial organisms in demonstrating extinction, little was understood about ocean life at the beginning of the 19th century. Aware of the significant gaps in their knowledge, naturalists of that era were reluctant to assert that certain marine animals represented by fossils no longer existed anywhere on Earth; they considered the possibility that these organisms might still be living in some deeper, unexplored part of the ocean (","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1},"end":{"line":83,"column":1}},"key":"A9YTuT0QWR"},{"type":"link","url":"https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1},"end":{"line":83,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Eicher 1976","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1},"end":{"line":83,"column":1}},"key":"UJV6fgR5dV"}],"urlSource":"https://archive.org/details/geologictime0000eich_z7h8","key":"QVgg3JOz0H"},{"type":"text","value":").","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1},"end":{"line":83,"column":1}},"key":"MLuBeriiTa"}],"key":"nP3mPowarv"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1},"end":{"line":85,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Following William Smith’s work on faunal succession, ","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1},"end":{"line":85,"column":1}},"key":"GKY8fHQ0es"},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1},"end":{"line":85,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Georges Cuvier","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1},"end":{"line":85,"column":1}},"key":"PUKPYOQSTg"}],"urlSource":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier","data":{"page":"Georges_Cuvier","wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/","lang":"en"},"internal":false,"protocol":"wiki","key":"uRJG8Ryaz6"},{"type":"text","value":" (1769–1832), a French naturalist and zoologist, developed the stratigraphic sequences of terrestrial vertebrates and marine invertebrates in the strata of the Paris Basin.

Mountains and coastlines are continuously formed and deformed because they are located at or near active plate boundaries. In contrast, features in the eastern United States, such as the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Coast, were created at plate boundaries long ago. Today, the nearest plate boundaries are more than a thousand miles away, and the landscapes in that region are gradually eroding.","position":{"start":{"line":149,"column":1},"end":{"line":149,"column":1}},"key":"n6NtcWM4he"}],"key":"gJzX1gnE82"},{"type":"div","class":"container","children":[{"type":"iframe","class":"video","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzqnUvE66HA","width":"100%","key":"yUZFtc16hO"}],"key":"Kjab9AkkEi"},{"type":"div","class":"container","children":[{"type":"iframe","class":"video","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DI6SemRT2iY","width":"100%","key":"PNImA39JSe"}],"key":"YQ9PK1hEFJ"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":162,"column":1},"end":{"line":162,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Rock Cycle","position":{"start":{"line":162,"column":1},"end":{"line":162,"column":1}},"key":"eEi1VQ0NXW"}],"identifier":"rock-cycle","label":"Rock Cycle","html_id":"rock-cycle","implicit":true,"key":"WtNX35Q4hy"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":164,"column":1},"end":{"line":164,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Rocks and minerals are all around us!
