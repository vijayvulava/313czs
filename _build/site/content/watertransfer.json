We will start by calculating a mass balance for an individual tree, then scale up to the catchment level. Multiple approaches will be employed, including an equation-based problem set and a graphical simulation exercise. This Water Transfers module encourages systems thinking, focusing on two key points: first, that in a mass balance, inputs must equal outputs plus the change in storage; and second, that a tree can be an integral part of the water balance. The module will also teach students how to scale from point measurements to catchment measurements and perform water balances at the catchment scale.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"vZR71IOx0y"}],"key":"slnpFgA0JK"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As you study water transfer within the CZ, consider how you will:","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"yXoLU2Q8Lh"}],"key":"Xz7x1mVpn4"},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"spread":false,"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Explain the reservoirs and fluxes of water cycling among the different components of the CZ.","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"key":"VdgTk9mIVr"}],"key":"vXOVSPeIEq"}],"key":"zMLuojwbpS"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Analyze the water budget of a catchment, incorporating both biotic and abiotic processes.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"R1ObGzMU47"}],"key":"zb18mteu3u"}],"key":"K1SRVPeA3G"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Calculate water budget components at multiple scales.","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"key":"dC8IpjflHa"}],"key":"Tha69dJeWd"}],"key":"lhZ3hXkN51"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Assess anthropogenic impacts on water cycling in a catchment.","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"key":"THrBP4IOOC"}],"key":"sHDqN0vA1v"}],"key":"TIRQD6Uble"}],"key":"pRVWEsjBJ8"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Goals of the Module","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"key":"g22Kg5OklJ"}],"identifier":"goals-of-the-module","label":"Goals of the Module","html_id":"goals-of-the-module","implicit":true,"key":"v6UkJ9kBYW"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Overarching Learning Objective:","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"iE6FAcuhAs"}],"key":"yiuBjlmxfL"},{"type":"text","value":" Describe and characterize how the interactions among the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and soil (the CZ) support and influence life.","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"gynFeQqE8r"}],"key":"ZmGNe1Aop2"},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"spread":false,"position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Unit 5.1: Vegetation acts as an intermediary in water transfers between the lithosphere and the atmosphere and regulates the discharge of water from subsurface to surface water bodies.
