# 1.1 CZ Overview

## Overview

The Critical Zone (CZ) refers to the Earth's outer layer, extending from the top of the vegetation canopy down to the subsurface zone where fresh groundwater circulates freely. Within this zone, complex biogeochemical processes occur, transforming rock and organic matter into the central component of the CZ: soil. The CZ is essential for sustaining nearly all terrestrial life, including humans. However, human activities increasingly harm the CZ, leading to significant negative impacts on this vital environment.

The study of critical zones (CZ) is inherently multi- and trans-disciplinary. Understanding critical zone processes requires an examination of interconnected physical, biological, and chemical interactions. A wide range of scientific expertise is necessary, spanning geology, soil science, biology, ecology, geochemistry, geomorphology, hydrology, and more.
